Keep reading to know more about her.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>From his recurrent role in the world-famous medical series, “Grey’s Anatomy,” to his appearances in “The Walking Dead,” <a href=#>Jeffrey Dean Morgan</a> has always been an onscreen sensation. His wife, Hilarie Burton, has also graced our screens several times thanks to her successful career as an actress.&nbsp;</p><p>The celebrity couple have two children together, and today, we’re focusing the spotlight on their second child, George Virginia Morgan. Here’s everything we know about the celebrity child and only daughter of the couple.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Jeffrey_Dean_Morgans_Daughter_George_Virginia_Morgan></span>Who Is Jeffrey Dean Morgan’s Daughter, George Virginia Morgan?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>George Virginia Morgan is a celebrity kid popularly known as Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Hilarie Burton’s only child. Like most Hollywood kids, she was born in New York on February 16, 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>She is only five years of age as of 2023 and is growing into a beautiful young girl. George is still in her early years, so she has no educational background or career pathway.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/46283494_2036946136596901_2955832910134902784_n.jpg><p>Although fans expect her to become an actress or choose a career in Hollywood when she comes of age. George has the liberty to be whatever it is she wants, thanks to the solid foundation her parents have laid.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Hilarie_Burtons_Children></span>Who Are Hilarie Burton’s Children?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hilarie Burton is one of the few Hollywood celebrities who has always kept her children’s lives out of the media. She shares two wonderful kids with her husband, Jeffrey, and rarely gives insight into what the kids are like.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/49097716_2064092290548952_4058338843080785920_n.jpg><p>However, in a part memoir, part spell book titled “Grimoire Girl,” Hilarie described how life is with her kids. In an excerpt from the book, she wrote: “When I make spaghetti sauce or chili, I make a point of having my son with me as we crush the whole Italian tomatoes in the pot by hand. I tell him to make a wish or an intention with each tomato he squeezes.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Gus_Morgan></span>Gus Morgan<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The couple has a young boy named Gus as their first child and son. He was born in 2010 and is currently 13 years old as of 2023. Gus has made several red-carpet appearances with his father but is still heavily protected from the harshness of the media and fans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To the delight of fans, Gus’ appearances did not end on the red carpet as the celebrity son has already made his acting debut. He is now <a href=#>credited as an actor</a> following his debut role on AMC’s popular show, “The Walking Dead.”&nbsp;</p><p>He starred as a zombie in an episode titled “Out of the Ashes,” fans were overjoyed to see him do his thing. His dad took to social media to relay his excitement in an Instagram post showing Gus in action and behind the scenes. The caption read, “My dude. Me, @hilarieburton, and George, THAT’S MY BOY!! We are super proud of Gusy Dean. Thanks to @amcthewalkingdead and @gnicotero for making a dream come true…”</p><p>The youngster is also known to be a loyal fan of Elvis Presley despite his age. To celebrate his first day of seventh grade, his mother shared an image of him rocking an Elvis-inspired look. &nbsp;</p><p>While attending the movie premiere of “Rampage,” Jeffrey talked about his son. He said: “I’m just so proud of him; he’s such a good kid..this amazing, polite kid who is very thoughtful and asks questions. He’s big on his pleases and thank yous, and it makes me so proud to take him to an event like [the Rampage premiere] and see how he interacts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/29983740_1420393718066749_8537148385326951230_o.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jeffrey_Dean_Morgan_and_Hilarie_Burtons_Childbearing_Struggle></span>Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Hilarie Burton’s Childbearing Struggle&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Hollywood stars had their first child in 2010 and had their second in 2018. This is a massive gap between the siblings, and fans have always wondered if that was always their plan from the start.&nbsp;</p><p>However, both Hilarie and Jeffrey have been open about their <a href=#>struggles</a> regarding their children’s births. They had their first son quickly, while their daughter was born after eight years of trying to have a child.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the two former “Grey’s Anatomy” actors, they planned to wait for only a few years after their first child to have a second. Sadly, things didn’t go as planned, and the couple tried for a long time to get George.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, George is often called a “miracle baby,” as they had begun to give up when Hilarie became pregnant with her. Gus and his sister are reportedly close and enjoy spending time together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51krq24jJqZqK2kYrSmu9GgnGaumae0qrrImmSmp6Kcrq95yZ6dn6qVrnqlscCnqmackaq0qcDEq2Y%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fall-about-george-virginia-morgan-jeffrey-deans-daughter.html&text=All%20About%20George%20Virginia%20Morgan%2c%20Jeffrey%20Dean%27s%20Daughter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-about-george-virginia-morgan-jeffrey-deans-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-about-george-virginia-morgan-jeffrey-deans-daughter.html&title=All%20About%20George%20Virginia%20Morgan%2c%20Jeffrey%20Dean%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fall-about-george-virginia-morgan-jeffrey-deans-daughter.html&title=All%20About%20George%20Virginia%20Morgan%2c%20Jeffrey%20Dean%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fall-about-george-virginia-morgan-jeffrey-deans-daughter.html&title=All%20About%20George%20Virginia%20Morgan%2c%20Jeffrey%20Dean%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-about-george-virginia-morgan-jeffrey-deans-daughter.html&description=All%20About%20George%20Virginia%20Morgan%2c%20Jeffrey%20Dean%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./editorialsback-black-editorial.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Back to Black: A Fashion Editorial">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-crown-mouse-season-4.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where to Find the Mouse The Crown Season 4">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
