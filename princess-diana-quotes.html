"<strong>Hugs can do great amounts of good</strong>," she quipped, and it's certainly hard to disagree with her.</p><p id=eFt0KndvjnH data-wc=71>Humanitarian causes were always at the heart of Diana's royal activities, and she often spoke to those who may have been dismissed by wider society. In a particularly poignant quote, Diana explained how sometimes the best way to express self-love is to actually show love for others. "<strong>Every one of us needs to show how much we care for each other and, in the process, care for ourselves</strong>," she famously said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c264adca69e-princess-diana-mines.jpg><p id=eSFwDhq_-pq data-wc=76>Born into high society, some of Diana's suitors might have believed that to win her affections would be as simple as lavishing her with gifts. However, as she explained, the main qualities she sought in a partner didn't carry a monetary value. "<strong>I don't want expensive gifts; I don't want to be bought</strong>," she stated. "<strong>I have everything I want. I just want someone to be there for me, to make me feel safe and secure.</strong>"</p><p id=e3R3h78mywM data-wc=64>Sometimes in life, there can be pressure to settle down with someone. However, this was not a mantra that the late Princess of Wales went, revealing that sometimes you can live a happier life without someone else in it. "<strong>People think that at the end of the day a man is the only answer</strong>," she shared. "<strong>Actually, a fulfilling job is better for me</strong>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d068791978ff-princess-diana-prince-charles-italy.jpg><p id=eqNfKE_2l0E data-wc=100>The royal truly understood how people felt and could quickly tap into the desire to be loved. She once shared how she believed one of the worst problems faced by some was a lack of love in their lives. Countering this, Diana shared: "<strong>I think the biggest disease the world suffers from in this day and age is the disease of people feeling unloved. I know that I can give love for a minute, for half an hour, for a day, for a month, but I can give. I am very happy to do that, I want to do that.</strong>"</p><h2>William and Harry</h2><p id=en-4jTy99lx data-wc=110>Although Diana sadly did not live long enough to see her children fall in love and start their own families, she was able to impart wise words to her kids before she passed. Speaking about her son William, she said: "<strong>I went to the school and put it to William, particularly, that if you find someone you love in life, you must hang onto it, and look after it, and if you were lucky enough to find someone who loved you, then you must protect it.</strong>" And given that the Prince of Wales has a long-standing relationship with his university sweetheart, Princess Kate, we're sure he took it to heart.</p><p id=epdQF7NkaWi data-wc=52>Diana doted on her two sons, and it's clear from any photo of the family that her brood occupied a special place within her heart. It's no surprise that she once said: "<strong>Family is the most important thing in the world</strong>," and this is a motto we believe she strongly lived by.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/718a322e5f48-princess-diana-prince-william-prince-harry-piano.jpg><p id=ejRCnY5RgcC data-wc=30>Just like any parent, Diana's sons meant the world to her, and this was clearly communicated when she stated: "<strong>I live for my sons. I would be lost without them.</strong>"</p><p id=ek0FDFcvtiV data-wc=49>The late Princess of Wales was certainly attuned to other peoples' feelings, and this is a quality that she strove to instil in her sons as well. <strong>"I want my boys to have an understanding of people's emotions, their insecurities, people's distress, and their hopes and dreams</strong>," she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ff09e20a0cd5-princess-diana-prince-william-eton.jpg><p id=e1GhSSRLICYc data-wc=65>Diana knew that her sons would have different lives than many, and while she wanted their lives to be as normal as possible, she also knew they would carry out public duties as they got older. Speaking on their futures, she said: "<strong>I will fight for my children on any level so they can reach their potential as human beings, and in their public duties.</strong>"</p><h2>Kindness</h2><p id=exyWzoeGvshd data-wc=53>One of the best quotes that truly embodies how the late Diana was the 'People's Princess' was her attitude towards kindness. She said: "<strong>Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you</strong>." What a selfless individual!</p><p id=egnnWpM_gb-D data-wc=123>One of Diana's most endearing moments was when she visited patients living with HIV at a time when myths around the illness were rife and those living and dying from the virus were shunned by wider society. Countering one of the main myths in a statement, Diana said: "<strong>HIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them a hug. Heaven knows they need it. What's more, you can share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys.</strong>" Diana was one of the first major public figures to show support and it wasn't just in passing, as for the rest of her life, Diana would support people living with HIV, something her son Harry still does.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7f31250c40b5-princess-diana-lighthouse.jpg><p id=eiqeVSdKhDy6 data-wc=45>Diana had an unconventional approach to her royal duties, and in part, this was due to a motto that she lived by on what best to listen to. "<strong>I don't go by the rule book… I lead from the heart, not the head</strong>," she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/db170d99725a-princess-diana-paris.jpg><p id=eLFaQ5YHJOhx data-wc=33>The late Princess of Wales always saw the value in people and in one of her sweetest quotes, she said: "<strong>Everyone needs to be valued.
