'Perhaps it shows what a good choice we have both made in location. But many Chinese dream of owning a chateau in Bordeaux.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang bought the estate in February. Within eight kilometres of this spot, Zhang and Qu could meet up with three other Chinese proprietors: Hong Kong investor Steve Loo Chung-keung at Chateau Lagarosse in Tabanac, the Dashang Group-owned Chateau Lezongars in Villenave-de-Rions, and Meng Gao at Chateau Bertranon in Sainte-Croix-du-Mont.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It fits with the open spirit of Zhang's ambition that his arrival was marked by a press conference and contract signing ceremony - something that has happened with only one other Chinese purchase, that of Chateau de Viaud by state-backed China Oil & Foodstuffs Corporation (Cofco).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company also held a press conference in February, when it announced that the main motivation in buying Viaud was to control the supply chain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the time, Cofco vice-president Chi Jingtao said the Chinese government was particularly interested in assuring products sold in China were authentic and unadulterated. 'We have a strategy for constructing a complete chain from production to consumption to guard against forgeries and to reassure our clients. Being involved from the vineyard upwards in Bordeaux helps to strengthen this commitment, and investing in vineyards internationally is part of the fight against fraud.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang's motivation is quite different. Through a translator, tourism consultant Li Lijuan, he explains that winemaking will be left in the hands of French oenologist Karine Lemaitre. By June next year, a luxury guest house will open at the chateau, with an upscale Chinese restaurant on the ground floor. Tennis courts and a nine-hole golf course have planning permission, and there are plans to become a fully fledged hotel with spa if the response proves enthusiastic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Every detail has been meticulously conceived. The restaurant will be run by Lei Wuan, a restaurateur from Guangxi, with renowned and emerging Chinese chefs invited for residencies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Once things are up and running, we hope to welcome about 10,000 Chinese visitors a year,' Zhang says. 'But European guests will also be welcome.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Confirming the plans by telephone from China this week, nearly three months after the signing ceremony, Zhang says: 'We have already begun to plant more vines, to increase the density, and have bought new harvesting equipment and generally begun working on the wine quality. We are calm; there are no bad surprises yet - some holdups with the plans, some staff changes, but nothing that isn't normal in setting up a new business anywhere.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang also differs from many of his compatriots with his stated desire to keep about 20 per cent of the chateau's production in Europe. Far more typical is the approach taken by Cofco with Viaud, or Qu with his five estates, or Steve Loo at Lagarosse, where 100 per cent of the wine is distributed through the mainland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since its purchase last year from American investor Stephen Adams, Lagarosse has become the flagship property of Carlico International. This holding company, based in Hong Kong, imports wines from across France. Taking care of on-site operations is director Benoit de Guigne, who is overseeing a project to restore the stunning chateau - parts of which date to the 14th century - to its original glory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But however beautiful things are going to look for Bordeaux visitors, the focus of the production is 8,000 kilometres away, with the 30 shops, 12 offices, three importing bases and 400 distributors that Carlico has in place in Hong Kong and the mainland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Adams had good distribution in place beforehand,' says de Guigne. 'But since we began sending the wine to China, stocks at the chateau have never been so low. We have got two more containers leaving next week, and after that, I am going to have to wait until we bottle the new vintage.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lagarosse produces about 200,000 bottles per year and, together with the other wines that it sources and distributes from Bordeaux, Burgundy and beyond, its shipments to the mainland amount to about one million bottles per year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many of the recent Chinese owners follow this same pattern of exporting not only their own wines, but also those of neighbouring estates, benefiting from strong networks and from the first mover advantage of being buyers in Bordeaux while it is still fairly novel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A downside - for a Bordeaux wine trade that has survived for centuries through local brokers, wine merchants and chateaux all supporting one another with a cosy network of sales and commissions - is that many of these new owners bypass the traditional routes and export directly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Marc Sabate, partner at MK Finance in Paris, has advised on three sales (Grand Moueys, Richelieu and one other 'confidential transaction'). He points out that many Chinese owners don't have a long history of working in the Bordeaux marketplace, so they don't see the need to support it. 'But before the locals get upset about this, it is worth remembering that many of the estates that have been bought over the past three years were finding it tough to place their wines in traditional markets,' he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Philippe Raoux, former owner of Chateau de Viaud, is an exception. He has built a strong relationship with Cofco since the sale of the chateau, with his wine merchant company becoming a partner in its plans. 'Last year, I sold Euro3 million (HK$31 million) of wine in China,' he recently told a French wine magazine. 'In just the first two months of 2012, my company is already at Euro5 million worth of sales.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many experts think that rather than worry about the long-term fallout, the Bordelais should be keen to embrace the possibilities while they last.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eddie Yuan, Hong Kong-based adviser with Langfan Consulting (instrumental in five sales so far, with a few 'key acquisitions' pending), thinks there will be a further rise in sales over the next few years before they peak.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Private investors increasingly will be replaced by professional companies as the Chinese market matures, and spectacular gains on modest AOC Bordeaux wines will become more difficult,' Yuan says. 'Interest is already increasingly moving from Bordeaux towards other regions such as Burgundy's Cotes de Nuits. We should see a peak for the next two or three years, with the estates purchased becoming higher profile, before the numbers begin to reduce.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese-owned chateaux</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chateau Grand Moueys, AOC Cadillac Cotes de Bordeaux (Zhang Jinshan of Ningxiahong group)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chateau Latour Laguens, AOC Bordeaux (bought in 2008 by Haiyan Cheng, whose family own the property developers Group Longhai.
