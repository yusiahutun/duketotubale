We kept getting submissions like that.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz0ho001c3b6xgzjd982z@published data-word-count=102>Amateur chefs weren’t the only ones eager to show up on The Bear. If you’ve watched the second season, you know that numerous A-listers, including Oscar winners Olivia Colman and Jamie Lee Curtis, were just as psyched to let it rip alongside the principal cast. In fact, The Bear was such an enticing prospect that attempts to fill one recurring role turned into a bit of a feeding frenzy: When word got out that the casting team was looking for someone to play Claire, Carmy’s former high-school acquaintance, there was immediate and massive interest despite the character’s description being kept deliberately vague.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz0kl001d3b6x9dyfb3av@published data-word-count=73>“No one even knew what the role was, that it was a potential love interest,” says Jeanie Bacharach, a casting director who worked on the show and whose past credits include The Dropout, Station Eleven, and Ally McBeal. “It was just a new character on The Bear. I mean, agents and managers lost their minds. I literally have never had that many phone calls and emails on a recurring role in my life.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz0la001e3b6x5rrohzm8@published data-word-count=116>Having so many gifted actors attracted to the project was a blessing, but it also meant working through myriad scheduling issues and tough decisions about who made the most sense for each role and who seemed most likely to mesh with the intense, intimate process involved in making The Bear. During a conversation with Vulture, the four casting directors — Bacharach, who is based in Los Angeles, and the Chicago team of Rudnicke, Mickie Paskal, and AJ Links — discussed the process of building this all-star team of guest actors, ranging from award-winning performers to esteemed Chicago culinary figures, and dropped a couple of notable names who came close to becoming part of the Bear family.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljssz0hm001b3b6xx58udb6e@published>Molly Gordon As Claire</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/688/2d8/9ef8ec4e6d6089367659863910ba59e6b0-the-bear-guests.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz0qu001h3b6xvwa525hw@published data-word-count=68>Claire was the first role the team focused on casting in season two, and it was one of the trickier ones because of the mix of qualities it required. Showrunners Joanna Calo and Chris Storer told the casting team they did not want a super-recognizable actor in the role but hoped for someone established enough to hold their own in significant scenes, particularly opposite <a href=#>Jeremy Allen White</a>’s Carmy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz117001j3b6xoomqby6k@published data-word-count=32>“We needed someone who probably wasn’t going to be a discovery, but we also didn’t want anyone who was going to pull you out of it by being too recognizable,” says Bacharach.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz13r001l3b6xrow6qmgw@published data-word-count=70>While they read many actresses for the role, Storer had someone in mind from the beginning: Gordon, whom he had worked with previously in his capacity as an executive producer and director of the series Ramy. Gordon first connected with Storer after meeting his partner, Gillian Jacobs — a guest star in season two of The Bear! — when they worked together on the 2018 comedy Life of the Party.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz1bi001p3b6xcs3oom5k@published data-word-count=58>As Bacharach puts it, Gordon was “the bar,” and while the showrunners were open to other possibilities, no one else who auditioned managed to clear that bar. So they offered her the role, even though she didn’t do a single chemistry read with White, which Bacharach admits made FX, the network that developed the series for Hulu, nervous.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz1c2001q3b6xtxsbddoc@published data-word-count=49>“Chris knows these characters; he knows what he’s writing; he knows this world,” says Bacharach. “He just felt really strongly that it was not necessary. I think there was almost some magic to not seeing them until they were really together — he wanted that to all feel fresh.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljzv662h000f3b6xxirnnqsm@published>Robert Townsend as Emmanuel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/a3c/b9e/8cfc7e9534857e2d44b165be3c4792ec55-THE-BEAR-205-1877R.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljzuxx49000k3b6xgpdik6vj@published data-word-count=62>From the beginning, Townsend — the actor, comedian, writer and director behind the satirical classic <a href=#>Hollywood Shuffle</a>, among other things — was on a short list of actors considered for the role of Sydney’s supportive father. During discussions about who to cast, Townsend kept rising to the top of the list because of the combination of qualities he brought to the part.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljzuy191000p3b6xmaccv0d3@published data-word-count=68>“We needed to understand the strength of their familial bond and understand the ache they both feel for each other and the hole that the loss of Sydney’s mother left in both of them,” says Bacharach. “You really only need to take a look into Robert’s eyes and you can feel all of that pain, angst and worry, but also a deep well of love, joy and caring.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljzuy192000q3b6xfd3ycla9@published data-word-count=38>When The Bear team reached out to Townsend — who is, appropriately, a Chicago native — they found out that not only was he a fan of the show, but also of the woman who plays his daughter.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljzuy192000r3b6xnlx52int@published data-word-count=46>“I believe he and Ayo had already been in communication as a result of his being a fan of not only the series but her work as well,” says Bacharach. “Their chemistry on screen is magical and you immediately buy into their history and complex relationship.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljssz0m1001f3b6x7wmkjku3@published>Will Poulter As Luca</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c9c/bce/bead29858fae106a91dabbf69f89a0d50d-the-bear-robert-townsend.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz1dq001r3b6xnu4vsleu@published data-word-count=52>Poulter, whose credits include Midsommar, Dopesick, and, <a href=#>most recently</a>, his MCU debut in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, was one of those actors who became a huge fan of The Bear’s first season — so huge, in fact, that he contacted Storer to express his interest in a hypothetical future role.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz1fi001s3b6xsh0nwn7q@published data-word-count=57>“He had reached out to Chris after season one to just say how much he loved the show,” says Bacharach. Poulter also mentioned that if there was ever a part that seemed right for him, he was game to play it: “So early on [in season two], those conversations about Will for the Luca role were happening.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz1ny001u3b6x7vgxogql@published data-word-count=63>The biggest hurdle to casting Poulter as the chef who mentors Marcus in episode four, <a href=#>“Honeydew,”</a> was working out the scheduling and logistics around having him travel to Chicago. (While much of that episode was shot in Copenhagen, the interior restaurant scenes were filmed in Chicago.) But “once we knew it was a possibility,” says Bacharach, “we really didn’t talk about anybody else.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljssz0p5001g3b6xpjh8ecgz@published>Jon Bernthal As Michael Berzatto</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d49/8af/9e4f649ed995c48a67ac780eaeb198107e-Bear-.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz1pz001v3b6x2rjtunko@published data-word-count=75>In the second season’s Christmas <a href=#>flashback episode</a>, “Fishes,” Bernthal returns as Carmy’s late brother, Michael, a role that might have helped inspire other high-profile actors to come and play in the show’s version of Chicago. Despite a relatively small amount of screen time in season one’s&nbsp;<a href=#>“Ceres,”</a> Bernthal made a huge impact by bringing Michael’s charismatic personality to life in a great example of that classic adage about there being no small parts, only small actors.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz1x9001w3b6xuwg3wmqe@published data-word-count=46>As Bacharach recalls, they almost were not able to get Bernthal because he was busy shooting Showtime’s American Gigolo at the time: “The dates looked problematic, so we started talking about other people.

Then the team turned to Mulaney, also a friend of Storer’s and a fan of the first season, who had the mix of contradictory qualities they wanted for Stevie: He looks like a nice, unassuming guy on the surface, but underneath he’s got a dark enough sense of humor to loan the Fak brothers $500 purely for the entertainment value of watching their baseball-card scam implode.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz3we002b3b6xt33shbbt@published data-word-count=24>“It’s just fun to put people who are unexpected in these parts,” says Bacharach. “As Chris likes to say, ‘What’s going to make noise?’”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljssz15s001n3b6xefd93euq@published>Gillian Jacobs As Tiff</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/976/360/05e06f50d31c7905d72f31893f6843e39b-THE-BEAR-206-11.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz3zs002c3b6x1ni8u7j7@published data-word-count=81>In the first season of The Bear, Richie’s ex-wife and the mother of their daughter is heard but not seen, appearing only on the other end of a phone call that Richie makes from jail. As a favor to Storer, Jacobs recorded Tiff’s dialogue for that scene, so when it came time to cast the part for “Fishes,” it made sense from a continuity perspective for Jacobs to fully inhabit the part. “Chris thought that would be really fun,” says Bacharach.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljssz17m001o3b6x7fqi771i@published>Olivia Colman As Chef Terry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d36/6d5/f222b0bf14f135edc2b45d2204930f5288-THE-BEAR-206-0239R.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz432002d3b6x8ouquu0t@published data-word-count=58>The role of Terry, the gifted chef who runs the high-end restaurant where Richie stages in <a href=#>“Forks,”</a> demanded an actor with some gravitas. The showrunners and Bacharach had a “dream list” of potential people to fill the role that included Colman and “a couple of other people that Joanna, Chris, and I all were talking about,” says Bacharach.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz48v002e3b6x3gurgbpe@published data-word-count=60>Colman’s U.S. agent was not sure that her client would want to do it, which suggested that maybe their dream list was dreaming too big. But that agent referred Bacharach to Colman’s U.K. representative, who turned out to be a huge fan of The Bear, as was Colman, which more or less sealed the deal for Colman to come onboard.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz4ak002f3b6xqcke7fmp@published data-word-count=16>“Once that was established, then it was just working out the details from there,” says Bacharach.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljssz1m7001t3b6xxk9czv8u@published>The Restaurant Staffs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e91/dfe/de4d6788dd50f2c62acbb921dfa8eef93a-the-bear-colman.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Donnie Madia, advising Ayo Edebiri’s Sydney.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz4fa002g3b6x1sl1l2hm@published data-word-count=62>All of the scenes in The Bear that take place in Chicago restaurants — including Sydney’s visits to multiple eateries in the <a href=#>third episode</a>, “Sundae,” as well as Marcus and Richie’s stints in other kitchens in “Honeydew” and “Forks” — were shot in actual Chicago eateries with the casting directors pulling many of their background actors and supporting players from those establishments.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz4is002h3b6x1jhebsjh@published data-word-count=33>“We taped 25 staff members at Avec and at Ever and at Kasama,” says Paskal, referring to the celebrated Chicago restaurants that make cameo appearances in the second season. “And it was amazing.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz4kq002i3b6x6dsqbqs1@published data-word-count=43>The casting team wanted to use as many actual staffers as possible because they already knew how to navigate the kitchens and dining rooms where production was taking place.

Claire McDonal, the general manager at Avec who leads a team meeting at the restaurant in the same episode, wasn’t up for playing that part at first.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz4y2002n3b6xq0utrzxa@published data-word-count=38>“She didn’t want to audition,” Paskal says. “I chased her down a staircase.

The casting teams in both Chicago and L.A. always have that at the forefront of their minds.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz55z002p3b6x51an0pdi@published data-word-count=32>“The mix of real people as themselves, real people not as themselves, famous people not as themselves — the mix is tricky,” says Links. “But that balance, I feel, is totally right.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljssz58a002q3b6xs1q6e8jh@published data-word-count=74>“Jeanie’s work is the cannoli, right?” says Paskal, turning to a food analogy, as one inevitably does when discussing The Bear. “We’re looking for the pistachio crema, and if it doesn’t work together, then we’re effed. She has created this amazing dish and then we’ve got these little garnishes — but they’re so important, right? Because if the garnish is wrong or it looks suspect, all of a sudden the whole plate is blown.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljzuyzlw000v3b6xkgcw7kud@published data-word-count=8>This story has been updated with additional information.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cljrerxes00000ieibkfpttxb@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Donna Effect</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clj7e593f001l0ii90laj5ryi@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Bear Serves Up Cameo Chaos</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clj7htuvk00000ig12xakfj0m@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Bear Recap: The Christmas Guests</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Pretty Much Everyone Was Dying to Guest-Star on The Bear</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmny1tMRmmZ6ZomLApq3SqKVmal2cwqa%2F02aqrZmiYrCiv9OipaBlla29ra3Ip5ydZpipuq0%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-bear-season-2-guest-star-casting-explained-html.html&text=Pretty%20Much%20Everyone%20Was%20Dying%20to%20Guest-Star%20on%20The%20Bear&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-bear-season-2-guest-star-casting-explained-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-bear-season-2-guest-star-casting-explained-html.html&title=Pretty%20Much%20Everyone%20Was%20Dying%20to%20Guest-Star%20on%20The%20Bear" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-bear-season-2-guest-star-casting-explained-html.html&title=Pretty%20Much%20Everyone%20Was%20Dying%20to%20Guest-Star%20on%20The%20Bear" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-bear-season-2-guest-star-casting-explained-html.html&title=Pretty%20Much%20Everyone%20Was%20Dying%20to%20Guest-Star%20on%20The%20Bear" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-bear-season-2-guest-star-casting-explained-html.html&description=Pretty%20Much%20Everyone%20Was%20Dying%20to%20Guest-Star%20on%20The%20Bear" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./yon-gonzalez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Yon Gonzlez dating?
