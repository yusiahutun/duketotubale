Did you know GM offered its first production EV, the EV1, in the mid-1990s, before Tesla even existed? It didn't keep its lead, though, and now the American car giant is trying to catch up to Tesla.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>GM is ramping up its EV efforts once again, and it's working on quite a varied lineup of very promising electric vehicles. Let's explore GM's coolest new EVs!</p><h2 id=2024-chevrolet-silverado-ev>1. 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV</h2><p>The Silverado EV is Chevrolet's entry into the electric pickup truck segment. Surprisingly, it's not the brand's first foray into the world of electric trucks, and some Chevrolet fans will remember that the brand released a battery-powered S-10 pickup. It was sold in low numbers between 1997 and 1998, powered by the same 114-hp motor as the EV1 and either 16 kWh or 29 kWh battery packs. The latter could provide up to 72 miles of EPA range.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Silverado EV is a completely different and far more capable beast. It can go 400 miles on a full battery, which should put it near the top of the EV pickup truck class when it's released. The important pickup truck specs are all there as well, especially the 10,000-pound towing capacity and the 785 lb-ft of torque. The truck can reach 60 mph from a standstill in less than 4.5 seconds, which means it's going to be a very fast truck.</p><p>The Silverado EV also looks very imposing, even without a traditional grille up front. The full-width light bar integrates very nicely with the Chevrolet badge up front, which is also finished in a menacing glossy black.</p><p>Thanks to its 800-volt architecture that allows for charging speeds of up to 350 kW, you'll also be able to recover around 100 miles of range in approximately 10 minutes using a DC fast charger. The Silverado EV looks very promising, and it should have no problem positioning itself among <a href=#>the best electric pickup trucks for sale</a> when it's released later in 2023 with a starting price of $41,595.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2024-chevrolet-blazer-ev>2. 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV</h2><p>The 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV is going to be one of the most attractively designed <a href=#>electric SUVs</a> when it goes on sale in 2023. The aggressive exterior design makes a statement, and the interior is just as exciting.</p><p>This is an electric SUV that wants to get your blood pumping, especially the SS version, which can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in less than four seconds thanks to the available 557 horsepower. The Chevrolet Blazer EV will also be able to travel approximately 320 miles on a fully charged battery, which means you will have no issues <a href=#>planning your EV road trip</a>. Peak charging speed is rated at 190 kW, enough to add 78 miles of range in just 10 minutes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The interior is one of the coolest you'll find in any EV. This is awesome considering the Blazer isn't an ultra-expensive vehicle that's inaccessible to most people. If you're thinking of buying a Chevy Blazer EV, the Adrenaline Red interior is a must-have option. Even the HVAC vents feature a striking design.</p><p>The Blazer EV also features Chevy Safety Assist as standard equipment, with technologies like Front Pedestrian Braking to help you drive safely. The Chevy Blazer EV will go on sale during the summer of 2023, starting at $47,595.</p><h2 id=2024-cadillac-lyriq>3. 2024 Cadillac Lyriq</h2><p>Cadillac is one of the most iconic brands in automotive history, and now the legend of American luxury is getting its feet wet in the electric vehicle segment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Its first bespoke EV is the Lyriq, which starts at $58,590, and the rear-wheel-drive version can travel up to 308 miles on a full battery. The interior is one of the most important elements of a luxury vehicle, and the Cadillac Lyriq definitely delivers here. The interior's party trick is the 33-inch curved display that sprawls prominently in front of the driver. The lack of a transmission tunnel also means that the Lyriq's interior is very roomy and designed in a way that optimizes legroom for all occupants.</p><p>You can also customize the Lyriq's interior to your liking by choosing from 26 available colors for the ambient lighting. Many interior trim pieces feature a knurled finish (like you might find in a Bentley), a very classy touch that gives the interior a unique look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Lyriq also helps you go the distance with its 308 miles of range, and it can charge at rates up to 190 kW. The Lyriq isn't a slouch when it comes to performance either: with the all-wheel-drive model making 500 horsepower, you know this is going to be a fast Cadillac. The model's more traditional luxury promises to be a refreshing departure from the current crop of electric vehicles, especially the minimalist take on EV luxury that Tesla has been known for.</p><h2 id=2024-cadillac-celestiq>4. 2024 Cadillac Celestiq</h2><p>If you've been waiting for an ultra-luxurious electric sedan, the Cadillac Celestiq is exactly what the doctor ordered. The Celestiq is not a vehicle for introverts. It is large, luxurious, and cutting-edge, with an imposing exterior presence and regal interior that evoke memories of Cadillac's glorious past. The brand hopes the Celestiq will usher in a new era where Cadillac is at the top of the class when it comes to luxury.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Celestiq is only available through inquiry, so VIP Cadillac customers will likely be given priority when it comes time to allocate reservations.</p><p>The front end is very reminiscent of the Cadillac Lyriq SUV, so Cadillac is clearly establishing a brand identity when it comes to the looks of its EVs. But the overall look of the vehicle is extremely majestic, like something you'd envision seeing Bruce Wayne pulling up to the opera in.</p><p>The Celestiq has one of <a href=#>the best interiors on an electric vehicle</a>. The cool part is that each vehicle is individually customized to its owner's specifications, so every interior will have unique touches. Cadillac is so serious about the Celestiq's customizability that it expects to build around two vehicles per day, which is an extremely low volume.</p><p>Expect the Celestiq to go on sale towards the end of 2023, with a price tag to match the level of personalization you opt for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chevrolet-equinox-ev>5. Chevrolet Equinox EV</h2><p>The Equinox EV will go on sale in fall 2023, preparing to wage battle in a very crowded and competitive electric SUV segment, populated by models like the Tesla Model Y, Volkswagen ID.4, and Hyundai Kona EV. The Equinox EV is bigger than the Bolt EV but smaller than the Blazer EV, and it will start at around $30,000 for the base model, which should make it very appealing to many people shopping for an affordable electric SUV.</p><p>There's no need to worry about range either because the Equinox EV can drive up to 300 miles on a full battery. The exterior is also very handsome, especially the front with its distinctive light bar and headlights encrusted into a black trim piece that runs around the entire front fascia. The side profile is very reminiscent of the Polestar 3 EV SUV, which is a good thing because the Polestar 3's design is very attractive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chevrolet made sure the top-of-the-range Equinox eAWD is no slouch with its 290 horsepower, but it can only tow 1,500 pounds. If you need an electric vehicle that can tow heavy loads, you should look elsewhere. With the arrival of the Equinox EV and the Silverado EV, Chevrolet will have a well-rounded electric vehicle lineup.</p><h2 id=general-motors-is-working-hard-to-expand-its-ev-lineup>General Motors Is Working Hard to Expand Its EV Lineup</h2><p>General Motors is no stranger to electric vehicles, and it's great to see that GM is fully embracing an all-electric future with its current lineup of electric vehicles as well as the models arriving in the near future.</p><p>Even though GM entered the EV game before most manufacturers, and you might say the company was ahead of its time with its EV1, now it's playing catch-up. However, there is still time for the company to dive headfirst into the EV space once again, and its upcoming offerings will have something for everyone, even those who have decided to wait before buying an EV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGienqaVp66tecyoq6iqo2Kyt7%2BMsqauZaOdvLa4w2aip6enYq6ju9StZGtoYmh8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgeneral-motors-evs-you-should-know-about-2023.html&text=General%20Motors%20Will%20Launch%20These%205%20Electric%20Vehicles%20in%202023&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeneral-motors-evs-you-should-know-about-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeneral-motors-evs-you-should-know-about-2023.html&title=General%20Motors%20Will%20Launch%20These%205%20Electric%20Vehicles%20in%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgeneral-motors-evs-you-should-know-about-2023.html&title=General%20Motors%20Will%20Launch%20These%205%20Electric%20Vehicles%20in%202023" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgeneral-motors-evs-you-should-know-about-2023.html&title=General%20Motors%20Will%20Launch%20These%205%20Electric%20Vehicles%20in%202023" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeneral-motors-evs-you-should-know-about-2023.html&description=General%20Motors%20Will%20Launch%20These%205%20Electric%20Vehicles%20in%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./544683-meet-lerays-mom-dad-ethnicities-nationalities-background.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Coi Leray's mom and dad: Ethnicities, nationalities, and background">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./coal-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="18 Fun Facts About Coal You Should Know">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
