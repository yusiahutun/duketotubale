But what we need to imbibe from the man is his <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon Leadership Principles</a>, his ideologies and this is not only for young and ambitious entrepreneurs but also anyone who wishes to do something new or something in life, as Amazon leadership principles apply to both personal and professional life, irrespective of the year, age and career line.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Leadership begins with leading yourself.</strong></h3><p>As Jeff Bezos after being the CEO of Amazon for over 24 years and is preparing to step down, it is mandatory to look at the Amazon Leadership Principles that he set up for Amazon, leading him to become one of the most successful businessmen of all time.</p><p>Let’s have a look at Jeff Bezos’s Amazon Leadership Principles and learn from them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Customer obsession</h2><p>The first of these Amazon <a href=#>leadership</a> principles is customer obsession, i.e., your customer always comes first, as leaders start with the customer, work relentlessly to earn their trust, etc. as a company cannot run or work without them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Ownership</h2><p>The next Amazon Leadership Principles he imparts is ownership, i.e., leaders are owners and they think long-term, they will never sacrifice long-term value over short-term results.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Invent and Simplify</h2><p>Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Are Right, a&nbsp;Lot</h2><p>Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Learn and be curious</h2><p>The next one is to learn and be curious, i.e., as a leader is always up for a challenge, they should never stop learning and questioning as that is what leads to unique ideas, innovation, and creation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Hire and Develop the best</h2><p>leaders always raise the performance standards with every hire, promotion, etc. recognizing the best talents and not afraid of experimenting with them throughout the organization. <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon AWS certification</a> can help you ladder up your AWS knowledge.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Leaders look for the best</h2><p>Leaders look for the best because they want to create leaders not order following employees and they should take this role seriously.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Think Big</h2><p>Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Frugality</h2><p>Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Vocally Self Critical</h2><p>Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. Leaders come forward with problems or information, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. A leader should be biased for action</h2><p>The world of business moves fast and thus, speed matters but one should always value calculated risk over decisions and plans that are irreversible, as</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>12. leaders dive deep</h2><p>leaders dive deep, i.e., no task is beneath them, they operate on all levels, are always connected, and are skeptical when numbers and figures do not match.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>13. Leaders have a back-bone</h2><p>If they find something wrong, they object, differ, and understand without any hesitation but once the decision is determined, they commit to it no matter what.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>14. leaders deliver results</h2><p>And most importantly, leaders deliver results, they focus on the important inputs, the time at hand, and deliver the best regardless of the challenges and setbacks.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Leaders are not born, they are made.</strong></h3><p>Jeff Bezos and his Amazon Leadership Principles not only took his company to new heights and made him and his company one of the biggest businessmen and companies of this century but also teaches us what it takes to become a leader because no matter how good the story sounds and how lucrative the perks and fame of being a famous businessman fetched you, it is not at all easy to become a successful businessman let alone reach among the top.</p><p>The only thing one should take away from this is, if he can you can and for one to achieve the same, they need to have principles that they follow to their core. All of this does not make one a leader but paves the way for one to become the best version of themself. Thus, a leader is much more than what meets the eye, and Amazon <a href=#>leadership principles</a> not only apply to professional but also to personal life.</p><p><strong>“One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out.”</strong></p><strong>–&nbsp;</strong>Jeff Bezos<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZK6urdmopWaklZaxpr7SoaCpZaCntq%2BvyKmjnqs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2famazon-leadership-principles.html&text=Powerful%2014%20Amazon%20Leadership%20Principles%20by%20Jeff%20Bezos&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famazon-leadership-principles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2famazon-leadership-principles.html&title=Powerful%2014%20Amazon%20Leadership%20Principles%20by%20Jeff%20Bezos" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2famazon-leadership-principles.html&title=Powerful%2014%20Amazon%20Leadership%20Principles%20by%20Jeff%20Bezos" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2famazon-leadership-principles.html&title=Powerful%2014%20Amazon%20Leadership%20Principles%20by%20Jeff%20Bezos" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famazon-leadership-principles.html&description=Powerful%2014%20Amazon%20Leadership%20Principles%20by%20Jeff%20Bezos" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ciara-wedding-dress-sketch-cavalli.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Roberto Cavalli shares beautiful sketch of Ciaras wedding dress">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./live-nation-taps-veteran-promoter-ken-craig-to-helm-new-ottawa-office.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Live Nation Taps Veteran Promoter Ken Craig To Helm New Ottawa Office">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
