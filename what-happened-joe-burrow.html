He then rolled onto the ground. Medical staff examined the leg and Burrow was swiftly taken away from the field on a cart.</p><p>Bengals coach&nbsp;Zac Taylor addressed his player’s injuries in a press conference. “I think a lot of guys after the first day have some soreness,” he told reporters, per&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Fox 19 Now</a>&nbsp;in Cincinnati. “He was just scrambling. This is football. Guys go down with an injury. This could be a day thing, who knows? There’s a lot of guys that had soreness today that had their reps cut down a little bit. That’s just part of football in training camp.”</p><p>Ja’marr Chase told reporters that he isn’t so concerned about his teammates injury. “We always give each other that nod,” Chase told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Athletic</a>. “He gave me a nod he’s all right.

Just getting checked out and had some discomfort so we thought we’d get it checked out. Turns out I had it. So we had to get it fixed.”</p><p>“When they cut into you and do all that stuff your core is going to lose some muscle and some strength just getting that back,” he continued. “I’d like to have a normal offseason at some point,” Burrow said. “That would be great. Going into the season feeling as good as I can, but that hasn’t been the reality for three years. Make the most of what you got. We’ll try again next year.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=july-2021-joe-burrow-recovers-from-acl-injury>July 2021: Joe Burrow recovers from ACL injury</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1287494089.jpg><p>In July 2021, Joe Burrow is still recovering from a torn MCL and ACL from his rookie season.

Burrow has ascended to the peak, but not without challenges. His story includes doubters and recruiting snubs. It includes waiting for a turn that would never come at Ohio State. It includes placing a bet on himself and transferring to LSU. It includes a devastating injury and the toughest test of his life. Ultimately, this is a story about staying grounded. Burrow has made it to the top of the mountain by keeping his head out of the clouds and feet firmly planted in <a data-pmc-sp-product=7e8b6e6d5c856e7661439e9a6ab33ba4 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Southeastern Ohio","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"From Bulldog to Bengal: The Joe Burrow Story Through the Eyes of His Hometown","price":"24.95","id":"1949248674","category":"Midwest"},"id":1620101,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Southeastern Ohio</a> soil. From shining a light on food insecurity during his Heisman speech to wearing clothing and cleats designed by hometown kids, Burrow has never forgotten his roots and those who have helped him along the way.
