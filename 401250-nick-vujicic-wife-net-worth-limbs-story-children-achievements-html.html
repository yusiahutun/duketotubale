His father was shocked by Nick's condition at birth and rushed to the doctor to inquire about his state. The doctor clarified to the father and informed him about the rare condition.</p><p class=align-left>Although Nick’s parents faced a great challenge raising him (the mother did not breastfeed him for the first four months), they gradually got accustomed to his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">special circumstance</a>. Nick even learnt to skateboard by pushing his body.</p><p class=align-left>The preacher with no arms or legs attended Runcorn State High School in Australia and obtained his high school certificate. He faced a lot of scrutiny at school because of his rare condition and even contemplated suicide at 8 years old.</p><p class=align-left>His parents helped him get through this phase, and Nick was even elected the Captain of MacGregor State in Queensland. He was on the student council that carried out humanitarian work.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a134e33615cbe6f7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dolvett Quince biography: wife, children, family, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Later, Nick joined Griffith University in Australia and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Accounting and Financial Planning.

This is a rare condition that a child lacks limbs except for just two toes. Therefore, he hasn't lost his limbs but was born with a rare condition.</p><p class=align-left>So, is Nick Vujicic a thalidomide baby?
