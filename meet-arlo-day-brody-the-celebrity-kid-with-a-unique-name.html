Here’s everything we know about her.</strong></p><p>While we know her name and some basic details about her birth, little is known about Arlo Day Brody. However, we know she lives with her parents and has a younger brother whose name hasn’t yet been disclosed. Even though her personal life remains mostly private, Arlo continues to be adored by fans worldwide.</p><p>So, what do we know about Arlo Day Brody?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Arlo_Day_Brody></span>Who Is Arlo Day Brody?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arlo Day Brody was born on August 4, 2015, in Whittier, California, to Adam Jared Brody and Leighton Marissa Meester. Details concerning Arlo’s education aren’t available now as her parents prefer to keep her from the limelight. However, considering how lovable this little star is, that hasn’t been very easy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3b6a6d6e6dcf69a6acaaf17e3da34826-fotor-20230619213159-edited.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Arlo_Day_Brodys_Parents></span>Who Are Arlo Day Brody’s Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arlo is lucky to have famous personalities like her parents. Her father, Adam Brody, is a multifaceted American actor, producer, and musician. Widely recognized as Seth Cohen in the acclaimed TV series “The O.C.,” he has also made notable appearances in movies such as “Mr & Mrs. Smith” (2005), “Jennifer’s Body” (2009), “In the Land of Women” (2007), and “Thank You for Smoking” (2005).</p><p>In addition to his acting career, Brody has ventured into producing, notably overseeing the TV series “Startup” (2016-2018). Furthermore, he starred in the DC superhero film “Shazam!” (2019) and appeared in its 2023 sequel.</p><p>Similarly, Arlo’s mother, Leighton Meester, is an accomplished American actress, singer, and model. Best known for her portrayal of Blair Waldorf in the popular drama TV series “Gossip Girl” (2007-2012), she has also showcased her talent in various movies, including “Killer Movie” (2008), “Monte Carlo” (2011), “The Oranges” (2011), and “The Judge” (2014).</p><p>Beyond her acting endeavors, Meester has pursued a musical career, with her song “Good Girls Go Bad” reaching the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. She has also released singles such as “Somebody to Love” (2009) and “Your Love’s a Drug” (2010).</p><p>While her parents are one reason for Arlo’s fame, her name also made her known.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Did_Arlo_Day_Brodys_Name_Draw_the_Worlds_Attention></span>Why Did Arlo Day Brody’s Name Draw the World’s Attention?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Arlo Day was born, her name caught people’s attention because it was unique, especially for a girl.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/0fa34ccf89dee800d549166b10a989a6-fotor-2023061921359-edited.jpg><p>Traditionally, Arlo is considered a name for boys and means “fortified hill” in English. It’s unclear why Brody and Meester chose this name for their daughter, but it may be because it has a down-to-earth feel. Also, it could be that since Brody and Meester are huge music fans, they decided to name their daughter after the famous folk singer Arlo Guthrie.</p><p>Then again, it could just be that they liked the sound of “Arlo Day” because it rolls off the tongue nicely. But if you think Arlo Day’s name is the only interesting thing about her, wait to hear how her parents met.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Arlo_Day_Brodys_Parents_Meet></span>How Did Arlo Day Brody’s Parents Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If you’re a movie fan, chances are you’re familiar with Adam Brody and Leighton Meester, who portrayed beloved fictional teenage heartthrobs Seth Cohen in “The O.C.” and Blair Waldorf in “Gossip Girl,” respectively.</p><p>However, their real-life love story is just as enchanting as the romantic plotlines on their popular shows. Brody and Meester’s journey began in early 2013 when they started dating, and by the end of that year, they were engaged. Their whirlwind romance led to a secret wedding just a few months later.</p><p>Following their nuptials, the newlyweds appeared together, supporting each other and attending events, although they maintained a high level of privacy. Then, on August 4, 2015, their joy multiplied as they welcomed their daughter, Arlo Day, into the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/a4bf2eaa1330ba147ac3390a1df79eb8-fotor-20230619213750.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Arlo_Day_Brodys_Parents_Happy_Together></span>Are Arlo Day Brody’s Parents Happy Together?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Years have passed since Arlo’s birth, yet Brody and Meester’s love for each other remains as strong as ever. In a September 2018 interview, Meester subtly referred to her then-husband of four years as her one true love.</p><p>“I’m happy where I am now,” she said during her interview. “And I think that that’s one of the many wonderful parts of not only having a child and meeting your soulmate, but also I feel really lucky career-wise — in a place that I want to be.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Arlo_Day_Brody_an_Only_Child></span>Is Arlo Day Brody an Only Child?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2020, when Arlo Day Brody was only five, the public received the exciting news that her family had grown with the arrival of a new member: her baby brother. Much like when Arlo was born, Adam Brody and Leighton Meester did not make any official announcements about the pregnancy or birth.</p><p>However, the “Gossip Girl” star’s visible baby bump spoke volumes. Through an off-hand comment by Brody on Twitch, the public learned about the arrival of their bouncing baby boy, marking the couple’s first son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/b87e05df8c0dc8862bacd9954a168f74-fotor-20230619213914-1.jpg><p>While participating in the special event “The Fun Time Boys Game Night Spectacular” on Twitch, Brody casually revealed the news, saying, “I have a new kid. Since the last I played, I have a new kid. I have a boy, and he’s a dream. He’s a dream boy.”</p><p>Both <a href=#>Leighton Meester </a>and Adam Brody have spoken up at different <a href=#>interviews </a>about their experiences in parenting. The ups and downs of being famous parents and everything in between.</p><p>However, due to their desire for privacy, Brody and Meester keep details about their children from the public eye, so their son’s name is unknown.</p><p>Now, shifting our focus from the life of Arla Day Brody, let’s dive into the world of <a href=#>Violet Krasinski</a>. She is the daughter of celebrated actress Emily Blunt and her husband, John Krasinski.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02aYq6SfYrGixYybqaicqWLBqbGMnJylnZKntrXFjKSgnWWnnsGpecBmrKehoaqybrrAppxo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-arlo-day-brody-the-celebrity-kid-with-a-unique-name.html&text=Meet%20Arlo%20Day%20Brody%2c%20the%20Celebrity%20Kid%20With%20a%20Unique%20Name&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-arlo-day-brody-the-celebrity-kid-with-a-unique-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-arlo-day-brody-the-celebrity-kid-with-a-unique-name.html&title=Meet%20Arlo%20Day%20Brody%2c%20the%20Celebrity%20Kid%20With%20a%20Unique%20Name" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-arlo-day-brody-the-celebrity-kid-with-a-unique-name.html&title=Meet%20Arlo%20Day%20Brody%2c%20the%20Celebrity%20Kid%20With%20a%20Unique%20Name" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-arlo-day-brody-the-celebrity-kid-with-a-unique-name.html&title=Meet%20Arlo%20Day%20Brody%2c%20the%20Celebrity%20Kid%20With%20a%20Unique%20Name" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-arlo-day-brody-the-celebrity-kid-with-a-unique-name.html&description=Meet%20Arlo%20Day%20Brody%2c%20the%20Celebrity%20Kid%20With%20a%20Unique%20Name" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./skai-jackson-child-stardom-shares-thoughts-tiktok-ban.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Skai Jackson 'Grateful' For Child Stardom, Shares Thoughts on Possible TikTok Ban">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./meaning-of-honeymoon-avenue-live-from-london-by-ariana-grande.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meaning of Honeymoon Avenue (Live from London) by Ariana Grande">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
