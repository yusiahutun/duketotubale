Never miss important updates</strong></p><h2>Early life</h2><p class=align-left>Zainab was born on March 23, 1992, in Harlem, New York. With 12 other siblings, her childhood was anything but conventional. According to the comedian, the big family had its pros and cons.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/67d376f7cb781582.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katy Tur's biography: husband, salary, family, parents, children, career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It gave her a sense of community, and hence she didn't feel the need to invest too much in outside <a href=#>relationships</a>. However, she sometimes felt overwhelmed, needing – but often lacking – space to be alone and breathe, not uncommon in a family of 15.</p><p class=align-left>Zainab Johnson’s religion is Islam, and she was raised as a devout Muslim. However, she has revealed how she hated being a muslin growing up. She was okay with the belief but found some practices quite inconvenient. Furthermore, it made her stand out, something she did not like.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/467957b666862059.jpg><p class=align-left>On top of that, she did not like how being Muslim was associated with fear in the media. When she was 15, Zainab started shedding off some religious practices, such as wearing a hijab. She also started exploring and discovering herself as a young woman.</p><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>comedian</a> has since embraced her Muslim heritage, and she regularly uses her experiences on stage. Zainab Johnson is of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ethiopian ancestry.</a> However, she was born and raised in the USA, making her an American national. Aside from her Muslim heritage, the comedian is very proud of being a black woman.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a9b707cbff58194f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jose Zuniga bio: net worth, girlfriend, house, Teaching Men's Fashion</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Zainab has not revealed much about her educational background. She presumably attended a local high school in Harlem, where she struggled to fit in during her "hating Islam" phase. However, she was a good student with excellent grades.</p><p class=align-left>While in high school, Zainab decided to study mathematics in college to become a teacher. She resolved this after she suffered a near-fatal accident, which made her question her life. She also wanted to honour her parents by graduating from university; they had attended college but did not complete their studies.</p><p class=align-left>While she was attending college, Zainab took an elective history course. It led her to learn more about her faith, causing her to accept and become proud of her heritage. Unfortunately, her father passed away soon after graduating. A friend she had made at the college convinced her to move to LA to become famous, which led her to give up her plans to become a<a href=#> teacher</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8baa2b427f746edf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lizzie Broadway: boyfriend, family, career, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Zainab moved to Los Angeles with the dream of becoming an actress. However, she struggled to make pathways in the industry. Then, one day, an opportunity came calling after she was asked to fill in for a comedy show producer. At first, she did not want the gig but figured it was decent paying and would only be for a few days.</p><p class=align-left>She found the gig exciting, which led her to develop a passion for comedy. As she interacted with comedians, she watched them, seeing what made their jokes work and what didn't. She also noticed that the industry was heavily dominated by male talent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/67d376f7cb781582.jpg><p class=align-left>After six months, Zainab quit working as an assistant. She looked up open mic events and attended one close to her home. The first performance was excellent, with the crowd responding positively. However, she thought it might have been a fluke, leading her to attend another event to be sure.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e658ceb1474895fa.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vicky Stark bio: husband, net worth, fishing, measurements</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After some time performing at open mics and other gigs, Zainab auditioned for and appeared in the comedy talent show, Last Comic Standing. Her performance was unusual due to her unique point of view. However, it was refreshing and entertaining, which saw her finish as a semi-finalist, thrusting her into the limelight.</p><p class=align-left>After<i> Last Comic Standing</i>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Zainab’s profile</a> as a comic grew. She also started landing major acting roles; she had a few minor acting credits before appearing in the reality <a href=#>TV show</a>. In 2016, she was cast into the HBO stand-up comedy show,<i> All Def Comedy.</i> A year later, she starred in the web series<i> Avant-Guardians.</i> Currently, she hosts the <a href=#>Netflix</a> show <i>100 Humans</i> and is a recurring cast member in the Amazon series,<i> Upload.</i></p><h2>Husband and children</h2><p class=align-left>The comedian does not share much information about her dating life, but she is presumably single; there is no evidence of being married on her social media profiles. However, she sometimes uses some of her dating experiences in her performances. For example, she once revealed how a guy she was dating broke up with her because she was Muslim.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0a411e7c969b080f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ashley Tervort: partner, family, rise to fame, net worth</span></p></a><h2>Net worth and earnings</h2><p class=align-left>What is Zainab Johnson’s net worth?
