In a video posted to X, the couple appear so in love as they share a sweet kiss and embrace at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square. In another video, Holland is captured whistling and filming Zendaya as she is introduced in the theater.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later in the day, the couple are seen in photos published by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies-tom-holland-and-zendaya-smile-while-spending-time-together-in-london-8631096 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>People</u></a> smiling widely while enjoying each other’s company in London.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">April 9, 2024: Zendaya gushes about Tom in a new interview.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a new <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vogue.com/article/zendaya-may-cover-2024-interview data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=interview class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">interview</a>, the Challengers star opens up about her relationship with Holland, who is set to appear in a West End production of William Shakespeare’s classic Romeo and Juliet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Zendaya says she “could not be more proud” of Holland’s work in the play, adding, “I’m going to try to see as many shows as I possibly can.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also praises her actor boyfriend’s ability at handling overnight fame after the two were cast as MJ and Peter Parker in Marvel’s 2017 Spider-Man: Homecoming. “We were both very, very young, but my career was already kind of going, and his changed overnight. One day you’re a kid and you’re at the pub with your friends, and then the next day you’re Spider-Man,” she says. “I definitely watched his life kind of change in front of him.

Everybody’s kind of got their own.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She then uses her answer as an opportunity to gush about Holland. “I think someone who has beautiful charisma, not on the Dune cast, but I personally—works for me—is Mr. Tom Holland,” she says. “I’m more shy and kind of quiet, so it takes a little bit more to pull me out of my shell. But he’s great at just talking to people and getting to know people. You see him on talk shows and stuff like that. He’s just naturally very good at that.
