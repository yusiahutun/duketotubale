Jennifer MacDonald among these three is a designer. Although she is only called “Jen” on the show, her full name is Jennifer MacDonald. Then, she is also known as Jenny.</span></p><p><span>Excited about the show’s release Jennifer was counting the days before the world could see her with a keen eye for detail and amazing ideas to turn a house into a home, whilst still preserving its natural history and aura.</span></p><p><span>If you do not already know, Jennifer stars on the show together with her husband</span><a href=#> <span>Mike Lemieux.</span></a><span> Yes, the history buff in the trio we mentioned earlier.</span></p><p><span>Jennifer and Mike, as the owners of </span><i><span>Full Circle Homes,</span></i><span> had spoken to WBZ-TV in 2020 for the station’s </span><i><span>It Happen Here</span></i><span> series.

Thereafter they also became business partners.</span></p><p><span>Every year, the 15th of December marks the couple’s anniversary. However, it was not understood if its a wedding anniversary or the day they officiated their relationship.</span></p><p><span>Recently, Mike took to his Instagram @ironandoilmike to express that Jennifer is absolutely the hardest worker he knows and the best partner he has ever had.</span></p><p><span>“She is relentless about trying to make everything just right, cares about everything she does and I love her for it,” Mike wrote.</span></p><p><span>Jennifer also believes Mike is her love, the best partner one could ask for, and the most positive person to be around.
