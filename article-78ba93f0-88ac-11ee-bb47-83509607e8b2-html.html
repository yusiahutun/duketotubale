Jones, 22, pleaded guilty in Jones County Circuit Court to felony malicious mischief.</p><p>“Based on the request of the victim,” Assistant District Attorney Kristen Martin said, the DA’s office was offering Jones a suspended sentence — on the condition that she gets help kicking her drug habit.</p><p>Instead of seeking the maximum sentence of up to 20 years in prison, David’s Grocery owners Jesse and Sharon Lancaster — the people most affected by Jones’ actions that September 2022 night — chose to forgive her and asked that she be granted grace and a chance to redeem herself.</p><p>“We all mess up,” Mr. Lancaster said. “Drugs are so bad in our community … and prison won’t solve the problem. Revenge doesn’t get you anywhere. It’s up to her now. It’s her decision, not ours.”</p><p>The name of the faith-based, in-patient rehab facility in Magee she was sent to sums up their hopes in a way that seems personalized for her situation — Beauty From Ashes.</p><p>Jones County Drug Court Director Consuelo Walley told the court that the defendant was not eligible for her program, but she agreed to transport Jones to the facility immediately after the plea hearing. Jones received a five-year suspended sentence, but if she leaves or is dismissed from the rehab program, the suspension can be revoked and she would then have to serve time in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.</p><p>“Make sure you comply and learn how to live a life free from substance abuse,” Judge Dal Williamson said to her.</p><p>Jones was also ordered to serve five years on post-release supervision under MDOC, participate in the court’s community service program and pay court fees and fines of $1,927.50. No restitution to the victim was required, Martin said, because insurance paid for the tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of damage.</p><p>Unlike during her initial court appearance, Jones didn’t have much to say during the proceeding. She went on an expletive-laced tirade in the courtroom when Jones County Justice Court Judge David Lyons set her bond at $100,000 back in September 2022. She spent 388 days in the Jones County Adult Detention Center.</p><p>Witnesses said that Jones left a residence on Robert Gentry Road — a dead-end street that runs alongside David’s Grocery — at a high rate of speed, and the Ford Ranger she was driving began “fishtailing” before it crashed into the restaurant side of the store, striking a main gas line and causing an explosion that caught the structure and the truck on fire. She then fled on foot and stashed a backpack behind a nearby residence, and it contained methamphetamine, marijuana and digital scales, narcotics agent Chase Smith of the Jones County Sheriff’s Department reported at the time. A volunteer firefighter later found Jones walking on Lower Myrick Road, near Victory Road, and she was arrested. Her partner Cassandra Gant, 31, — who was one of several inmates to be baptized at the Jones County jail a year earlier — was ordered in September to serve four years in prison after pleading guilty to selling meth.</p><p>“Beauty From Ashes” describes what’s happened at David’s Grocery, too. Even while firefighters were still battling flames and the rubble was smoldering, people from the community were pouring in to help.</p><p>“People came by with generators and ice chests, trying to help us save what we can,” Jesse Lancaster said at the time, shaking his head and fighting tears as he tried to grasp the right words. “We just appreciate them all.”</p><p>Still, Lancaster and his family were devastated by Jones’ actions, the brazenness and senselessness of it all after they had turned down offers to sell out to keep their independent operation going.</p><p>“Everything we do, we try to think of the community ... and then this,” he said, looking down and shaking his head.</p><p>He wasn’t sure at the time if they would rebuild and get back to business. But the outpouring of love and support helped them make that decision.</p><p>The store was out of business for a month or so, and the restaurant — which took the direct hit — was out of commission for about four months. But now, it’s all back, better than ever. Despite battling supply-chain issues, Cook Homebuilders restored the community staple in about half the time it was expected to take — and added space to seat about three dozen more people in the popular eatery.</p><p>The family-owned country store that opened 40 years ago was selected by Leader-Call readers as “Best Gas Station” for a second straight year, beating out more modern “super-sized” convenience stores that are in local municipalities.</p><p>He hopes Jones’ personal restoration can be as successful as the one at his family’s business.</p><p>“I hope she holds up her end … and the court holds up its end,” he said. “I hope she goes through with it. We’ve been blessed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcMHPZp2rp51iwamxjJqqoZ2jZK6zwMico56XZ22vooWSn2dmcGiWsG59kJ6cZpqSaYRuhJJuZ3JuYGyyea6RZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2farticle-78ba93f0-88ac-11ee-bb47-83509607e8b2-html.html&text=Up%20from%20the%20ashes%20%7c%20Free%20News&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2farticle-78ba93f0-88ac-11ee-bb47-83509607e8b2-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2farticle-78ba93f0-88ac-11ee-bb47-83509607e8b2-html.html&title=Up%20from%20the%20ashes%20%7c%20Free%20News" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2farticle-78ba93f0-88ac-11ee-bb47-83509607e8b2-html.html&title=Up%20from%20the%20ashes%20%7c%20Free%20News" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2farticle-78ba93f0-88ac-11ee-bb47-83509607e8b2-html.html&title=Up%20from%20the%20ashes%20%7c%20Free%20News" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2farticle-78ba93f0-88ac-11ee-bb47-83509607e8b2-html.html&description=Up%20from%20the%20ashes%20%7c%20Free%20News" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./max-pham-nguyen-bio-age-height-parents-dance-100.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Max Pham Nguyen?
