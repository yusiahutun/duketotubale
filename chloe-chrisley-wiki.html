Chrisley Knows Best is a tv reality show that focuses on Chrisley’s family living while they get busy with their day-to-day lives.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And when you have missed following the Chrisleys, you might be wondering who’s the apple of the eye of Todd and Julie. Therefore, let’s discover some facts about Chloe Chrisley, who is also popular as Kyle Chrisley’s daughter.</span></p><h2><b>Who is Chloe Chrisley?</b></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Chloe Chrisley, who likewise calls herself Coco, is a TV star, more familiar as the child of Kyle Chrisley and Angela Johnson. Chloe has been the eminent source of happiness of the family, and her playful tricks frequently bring a burst of huge laughter to her family and the viewers. She is undeniably cherished without exception by all members of the Chrisley household and has grown considerably famous on the program.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her parents’ relationship was not that long that she did not experience enough care and affection from them. Her early years were full of distress. According to her grandfather, Todd, Chloe is seeing a child psychologist, so we don’t have to worry about the child’s mental health.</span></p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4355 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chloe-Chrisley.jpg alt="Kyle Chrisley's daughter, Chloe Chrisley" width=750 height=485 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-4355 class=wp-caption-text>Chrisley Knows Best star, Chloe Chrisley</p><h2><b>How old is Chloe Chrisley? Age and Birthday</b></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>The precious little girl of the Chrisley family is turning nine this coming 10th of November. And based on her birth date, Chloe’s zodiac sign is Scorpio, which is assumed mysterious since they are secretive and deep thinkers; however, they are sensitive.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When she was only six months old, Chloe started to live with her grandparents since her parents were already separated. Chrisley Knows Best was launched when Chloe was at the age of one.</span></p><h2><b>Chloe Chrisley Mother</b></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Chloe’s mother is Angela Victoria Johnson, an average individual. She was born on the 26th of September 1968 in South Carolina, just a few hours from the Chrisley family. She is of African-American origin and has an American nationality.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Over the years, Johnson has had a very normal life, but not until he gave birth to the child of Kyle. She appeared in the spotlight as Chloe Chrisley’s mother. Kyle and Angela were together for several years, though they didn’t survive long since it was toxic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Angela was living contentedly with Kyle until he became addicted to drugs. Because of this incident, Angela encountered some difficulties; hence, she cut ties with him and moved out of the Chrisley home.&nbsp;</span></p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4357 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chloe-Chrisley-Parents.jpg alt="Chloe Chrisley Parents, Angela Victoria Johnson and Kyle Chasley " width=600 height=543 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-4357 class=wp-caption-text>Angela Victoria Johnson and Kyle <span style=font-weight:400>Chrisley</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Following the separation in October 2013, Chrisley’s family had brought a case against her. Angela fought for Chloe’s custody, but unfortunately, Chrisley won the trial, and Kyle earned visitation and was also granted child support obligations to meet.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2016, Angela was detained due to allegations of Medicaid swindle. And in December 2017, Angela Johnson became qualified to petition the claims to be removed from her account. And eventually, since February 2021, no allegations toward her, and presently, she starts living like an average person again.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Issue with Custody on Chloe</b></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>When Kyle charged Todd (his father) with abduction, the poor little Chloe was involved in a sensitive matter. But, afterward, Angela insisted that Todd was protecting Chloe since Kyle has bipolar.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And because Kyle has been combatting substance addiction and was also suffering from bipolar, he was imprisoned and can barely support Chloe correctly. Consequently, in 2013, he lost the guardianship of his daughter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And back in 2016, Chloe’s mother, Angela, was also detained for double-dealing food stamps and Medicaid. It was stated that she’s been receiving Medicaid advantages for more than three years by declaring Chloe was a dependent while the fact that she was staying with her grandparents.&nbsp;</span></p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4358 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chloe-Chrisley-Grandfather-Todd.jpg alt="Chloe Chrisley's Grandfather Todd" width=602 height=482 sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-4358 class=wp-caption-text>Chloe Chrisley and her grandfather Todd Chrisley</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her imprisonment resulted in problems about her guardianship of Chloe, and the grandparents were consequently given complete custody of Chloe. Chloe had been a significant member of Chisley’s family and cherished her spot in the family from that time.</span></p><h2><b>Chloe and Her Grandparents</b></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since she was a baby, Todd and Julie have supported Chloe because of some circumstances that made the parents incapable of raising their child correctly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Furthermore, many viewers are asking where Chloe is since the little girl has not been appearing in some episodes of the show. This was because of the open-ended judicial turmoil between Kyle and Todd. There was no legal ruling disallowing Chloe from appearing in the show. However, Kyle appealed for some share for her participation in the show, and Todd didn’t like such an idea. That is to say, he wanted his granddaughter to be spared from the problem since she was so young.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>What’s fascinating is that viewers noticed that Chloe addressed her grandparents as Papa and Mama. Please note that no one in the family told her to call her grandpa and grandma that way. Therefore, we can conclude that Chloe has started to view her grandparents as her parents, which is very touching.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>While Todd and Kyle had a tense relationship for ages, the father-and-son finally resolved their differences. There are stories that Kyle doesn’t have a grudge on how his daughter is being raised. And he appears to acknowledge that Chloe is content with her grandparents and doesn’t have to break that bond.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Regardless of all the tension and controversies around Chloe, viewers are delighted to see she is growing well in the custody of her grandparents.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2BMnJylnZKntrW1xKxlnKedZLCpuM6eZJygop7ArbHYZq6io5lk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchloe-chrisley-wiki.html&text=Chloe%20Chrisley%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Mother%2c%20Facts%20about%20Kyle%20Chrisleys%20Daughter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchloe-chrisley-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchloe-chrisley-wiki.html&title=Chloe%20Chrisley%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Mother%2c%20Facts%20about%20Kyle%20Chrisleys%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchloe-chrisley-wiki.html&title=Chloe%20Chrisley%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Mother%2c%20Facts%20about%20Kyle%20Chrisleys%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchloe-chrisley-wiki.html&title=Chloe%20Chrisley%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Mother%2c%20Facts%20about%20Kyle%20Chrisleys%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchloe-chrisley-wiki.html&description=Chloe%20Chrisley%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Mother%2c%20Facts%20about%20Kyle%20Chrisleys%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./eva-longoria-white-swimsuit-cutouts-mexico.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eva Longoria Glows in a White Swimsuit Covered in Cutouts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bible-verses-about-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="30 Meaningful Bible Verses About Children and Parenting">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
