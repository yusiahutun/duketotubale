Let's take a look at his wealth…</p><h2>Brian McFadden and Westlife</h2><p id=eKWD-VLCHl_ data-wc=102>The Irish singer found fame as a member of boy band Westlife, performing alongside Nicky Byrne, Kian Egan, Mark Feehily and Shane Filan. The group enjoyed incredible success in the nineties, releasing hits such as , , , and . A large part of his fortune comes from Westlife royalties, but in 2013, Brian told magazine: "I regret wasting so much of the money I earned from Westlife. I went through millions of pounds on cars, private jets and lots of rubbish. I have a lot less money now, but I'm far happier."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/db66477a0b1b-westlife-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eyIXPaC2eU_P data-wc=10><strong>Brian&nbsp;found fame as a member of boy band Westlife</strong></p><p id=e85fOC9OgtLV data-wc=82>Brian left the group in March 2004, saying that he wanted to spend more time with his family and work on solo projects. At the time, he was married to Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona, with whom he shares two daughters, Molly, 17, and Lilly-Sue, 15. Brian subsequently began a solo career, signing with record label Sony BMG. He went on to release Real to Me and Irish Son, which made it into the top ten of the Irish and British charts.</p><p id=esOMf6Jj9mKW data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>See photos of the royals before their very regal transformations</a></strong></p><p id=ehIaid7A3MKR data-wc=74>Brian parted ways with his record label in 2007 and instead formed his own label under the name BMF Records. Throughout the years, Brian has collaborated with his then-fiancée Delta Goodrem, Ronan Keating and Sinéad O'Connor. From 2016 to 2018, the father-of-two also teamed up with Keith Duffy, formerly of Boyzone, to <a class=hm-link href=#>form a supergroup called Boyzlife</a>. When Westlife announced their reunion in 2018, Brian was not involved. His new album, Otis, will be released in February 2019.</p><p id=e0n8qu6Ckl7K data-wc=131>Brian <a class=hm-link href=#>showed his encouragement for Westlife</a>, sharing the band's new single on Twitter and writing: "Love it! Great song great production. The boys are back!" But lead singer Shane has made it very clear that Brian will not be rejoining the group. "He left the band 15 years ago, we were only five years in and kids at the time," Shane told . "We went on to become a band for another eight or nine years after that. It would be very weird to have another person in the band again, some of us haven't seen Brian in a very long time. We haven't fallen out with Brian either. It's like we all went to a different school and he went another way. Brian left a long time ago so we're moving forward not backwards."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><h2>Brian McFadden's TV career</h2><p id=ea2-TD2R856A data-wc=69>Apart from making millions as a boy band singer, Brian has starred in various TV shows.

The couple later married in Italy in 2012 but split in 2015.</p><p id=excheJ41jcri data-wc=106>"We instantly clicked and talked non-stop for eight hours the night we met and I proposed eight months later," Brian told . "Within three weeks she moved to Australia to be with me. Although it was a whirlwind romance, it was just so right from the beginning, so we knew it would work. Meeting her was a life changer for me – she's my soulmate. Getting married hasn't changed anything – it was perfect anyway – but it has made us both feel quite grown-up. We like nothing better than just staying in and spending time together as a couple when we're not working."</p><p id=eWxaHvSBnnGm data-wc=51>Their split came as a shock to many. Vogue and Brian released similar statements, with Vogue's reading: "It is with sadness that Brian and I have <a class=hm-link href=#>made the tough decision</a> to go our separate ways.
