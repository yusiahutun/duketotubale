Queen B told&nbsp;Seventeen&nbsp;a year later that&nbsp;“I was 18 when we first met, 19 when we first started dating. The <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1355370/jay-z-net-worth/>relationship culminated </a>years later when Beyoncé made her solo debut in 2003 with her first single “Crazy in Love” featuring her now-husband.</p><p>The two secretly tied the knot in 2008. “It was a very emotional wedding—lots of crying—and really very spiritual,” a source told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a>.&nbsp;It was held at Jay’s 13,5000-square-foot penthouse in New York City; instead of rings, they both tattooed the number 4 in Roman numerals on their ring fingers.</p><p>“There was no rush—no one expected me to run off and get married,” Beyoncé&nbsp;told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Seventeen</a>. “I really don’t believe that you will love the same thing when you’re 20 as you do at 30. So that was my rule: Before the age of 25, I would never get married. I feel like you have to get <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1354771/beyonce-net-worth/>to know yourself,</a> know what you want, spend some time by yourself, and be proud of who you are before you can share that with someone else.”</p><p>However, their relationship had some road bumps which sparked some of the greatest pop culture moments in history. Here’s a timeline of Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s affair.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=beyonce-and-jay-z-s-affair-timeline>Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s Affair timeline</h2><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.4330289193303><h2>May 7, 2014: Solange attacks Jay-Z in an elevator</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/solange-jay-z.jpg><p>Jay-Z’s affair rumors were rampantly spread after the 2014 Met Gala. TMZ <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.tmz.com/watch/0-6lrpg6kh/ rel=nofollow>released footage</a> of Beyoncé’s sister Solange attacking the “Empire State of Mind” rapper in an elevator. The motive behind the attack was never disclosed, but fans suspected that it had to do with Jay-Z cheating on her sister.</p><p>The two later made a statement: “There has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family. The reports of Solange being intoxicated or displaying erratic behavior throughout that evening are simply false. At the end of the day, families have problems and we’re no different. We love each other and above all we are family. We’ve put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same.”</p><p>Beyoncé referenced the moment in her song “Flawless,” Of course, sometimes shit go down / When it’s a billion dollars on an elevator.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9728813559322><h2>July 2014: Rumors of Jay-Z and Beyoncé Divorce Plans emerge</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/beyonce-jay-z.jpg><p>Amid the On The Run tour, rumors emerged of Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s split amid the cheating rumors. “They are trying to figure out a way to split without divorcing. This is a huge concert tour, and they’ve already gotten most of the money from the promoters up front,” a source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Page Six</a>. “Jay was outdoing Jay, and Bey was outdoing Bey.
