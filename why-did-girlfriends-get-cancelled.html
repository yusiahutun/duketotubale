Hayes) as the sole guy friend in the group.</p><p>The comedy series premiered on UPN on September 11, 2000. In seasons seven and eight, the show moved over to The CW network.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why was “Girlfriends” canceled?</h2><p>After eight seasons, Girlfriends came to an abrupt end in 2008. The reason why the popular sitcom ended was due to it being too expensive to continue. As per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TV Series Finale</a>, the show’s rating began to decline over the years, and as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a>&nbsp;explains, its considerable cost in production was a call for producers to wrap up the sitcom.</p><p>“This was a very difficult decision for us and was based solely on the considerable cost to license each episode in an extremely unusual business environment,” said a spokesperson for The CW.</p><p>Following news of the show’s cancellation, fans went out of their way to have their dissatisfaction known, with some expressing their desire to have another season on the network.</p><p>According to The YBF, an inside source revealed that Comedy series creator, Mara Brock Akil, would have wanted to accomplish a ninth season, something the team felt they should have been allowed to do. Regardless Akil said the series still told the stories she wanted to share, reported Showbiz Cheat Sheet.&nbsp;</p><p>“Although it’s always difficult to say goodbye, I choose to focus my energy on the history that Girlfriends has made, the human stories that we told, the beautifully complex images that we projected, and the blessings 172 episodes bestowed on us, both personally and professionally.”</p><p>She continued, “I am immensely thankful to the amazingly talented cast, writers, directors, staff and crew for their endless dedication and hard work for eight seasons, to the network that always wanted us and the studio that always supported us, but mostly to the audience, especially African-American women, who took the time to tune into us every Monday night at nine to have a dialogue with us and who have been our partner in this journey.”</p><p>While saying goodbye to the long-running sitcom was hard for fans, what made it an even tougher pill to swallow was the announcement that the show was not going back to film more episodes to provide some sort of closure but instead opted to compile a few clips from the past for its series finale making a less than proper send-off.</p><p>“I am currently in talks with the studio and network on putting together a retrospective show which will honor and celebrate this landmark series, so please stay tuned,” said Mara Brook Akil.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Girlfriends cast reunion&nbsp;</h2><p>While The CW network never considered having Girlfriends return to bring a well-deserved closure for its millions of loyal fans, the show’s cast reunited as guest stars in an episode of ABC’s Black-ish in what came off as an opportunity to make amends to its improper send-off.&nbsp;</p><p>In an episode titled “Feminisn’t”, the Girlfriends squad relived iconic moments when Bow ( Tracee Ellis Ross) introduces her on-screen daughter, Diana, played by Marsai Martin, and mother-in-law Ruby (Jennifer Lewis) to her group of feminist friends from college after the two reveal they don’t believe in feminism.</p><p>There is even a moment when homage is paid to Girlfriends’ memorable theme song and opening sequence.</p><p>For fans who had not seen the beautiful women together for more than a decade and who were hit hard by the premature cancellation of the show, the reunion on Black-ish was special, and perhaps the closure they had for so long requested.</p><p>Speaking about the reunion, Tracee Ellis Ross said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that because they had not all been on camera together since 2006, reuniting as Girlfriends for a whole new audience was so much fun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCpYrGqsIygoKuklqe2prrDrGSgnaRisKK6wp6jpZ2UZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-girlfriends-get-cancelled.html&text=The%20reason%20Girlfriends%20got%20canceled&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-girlfriends-get-cancelled.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-girlfriends-get-cancelled.html&title=The%20reason%20Girlfriends%20got%20canceled" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-did-girlfriends-get-cancelled.html&title=The%20reason%20Girlfriends%20got%20canceled" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-girlfriends-get-cancelled.html&title=The%20reason%20Girlfriends%20got%20canceled" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-girlfriends-get-cancelled.html&description=The%20reason%20Girlfriends%20got%20canceled" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./htg-explains-what-is-a-vpn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is a VPN, and Why Would I Need One?">&larr;
