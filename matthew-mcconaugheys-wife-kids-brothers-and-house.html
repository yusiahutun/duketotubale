Today as far as we can we will take a look at the life of this special star Matthew McConaughey’s wife children brother and house.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Matthew McConaughey’s Wife</strong></h2><p>Mr. McConaughey was certainly fortunate to have married Camila Alves McConaughey, a Brazilian-American model, and designer who was born in Brazil on January 28th, 1982. After growing up there until she turned 15, Camila decided to move permanently after visiting her aunt in Los Angeles – a decision that proved quite advantageous for Mr. McConaughey!</p><p>At 19 years old, the star made a life-altering decision to move that ultimately paid off. Despite having worked as a cleaner and waitress for four years prior, she had developed an impressive work ethic and was fluent in English – two qualities that enabled her to retire at such a young age. Best believes it was these skills rather than the glamour or good life that gave her this opportunity.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Carmelo Anthony Wife, Son, Divorce, Height, Weight, Net Worth</a></strong></p><p>Camila Alves has achieved remarkable success in her career as a fashion model since moving to New York. Her accomplishments include founding the lifestyle website Women of Today hosting the live-stream video program Camila’s Code launching an organic frozen food company called Yummy Spoonfuls and co-hosting Food Network’s Kids BBQ Championship which debuted in May 2016.</p><p>Camila Alves and <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey</a> met in a nightclub where she worked behind the bar, an unlikely place to find true love. Ten years later, they are still setting an example of what it means to be devoted partners with their loving actions and three beautiful children. Camila has embraced her title as Mrs. McConaughey gracefully since that fateful night all those years ago, proving that dreams really do come true!</p><p>It was love at first sight for Matthew but his soon-to-be future wife didn’t care then later that night she clicked and years later they still have the stars in their eyes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Matthew McConaughey’s Kids</strong></h2><p>As we have already mentioned Matthew McConaughey’s wife has three children for him and boy are they adorable as if we would expect less? So let’s go and meet the little sweethearts; they have two sons and a daughter. Their names are Levi Alves McConaughey Livingston Alves McConaughey and Vida Alves McConaughey.</p><p>Levi is her first son and child he was born on July 7 2008 at 18:22 pm and weighed in at 7 pounds. Here is what the happy father had to say about the birth of his first child ‘A healthy little boy was born. Camila and I have been side by side all along we are both tired and excited and so happy to have created the greatest miracle in the world – having a child and starting a family – now comes the greatest adventure – raising one together.</p><p>Levi, another name for the apostle Matthew in the Bible, was born at a significant time – 6:22. This particular moment has deep meaning to Matthew as it is his favorite verse from the book of Matthew in The Bible; “When your eye is single your whole body will be full of light.” This meaningful phrase serves as an inspirational reminder that when we focus on one thing with clarity and purpose, our lives can be filled with illumination.</p><p>On January 3, 2010, Matthew and Camila McConaughey welcomed their daughter Vida Alves into the world. To share their joy with the world they posted a picture of her on Matthew’s website along with an accompanying message expressing gratitude for all the well-wishes and looking forward to a bright future.</p><p>The baby of the house is Livingston Alves McConaughey and little Tyke was born on 28 December 2012.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Matthew McConaughey’s Brothers</strong></h2><p>You bet he’s not the only McConaughey brother in town he’s got two other brothers and we’re about to hit rock bottom which is what’s wrong with them. There’s Rooster McConaughey who seems almost as popular as Matthew then there’s Pat McConaughey.</p><p>Michael Patrick McConaughey, born on August 2, 1954, in Houston Texas, and better known as Rooster to many of his fans is a prominent actor who has starred in movies such as West Texas Investors Club (2015), The Newton Boys (1998) and Black Gold (2008). He is also a self-made millionaire whose success story can be seen through the documentary series West Texas Investors Club.</p><p>Then there’s Pat, who seems to be far away from the spotlight, so there’s not much about him.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Katy Perry’s Boyfriend Husband Parents Sister House</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>House</strong></h2><p>Matthew McConaughey, the renowned Hollywood actor, is known to own some impressive properties. According to Celebrity Homes, his villa in Rivercrest near Lake Austin in Texas was originally bought for $6.6 million and is located within one of the most populous cities of the Lone Star State.</p><p>This luxurious “Spanish Mediterranean” villa was constructed in 1997 and offers an impressive 7 bedrooms, 8 bathrooms, an elevator, and two circular motor places which can accommodate up to four vehicles.
