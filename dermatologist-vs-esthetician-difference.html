The fact of the matter is that the answer will vary depending on the specific needs of your skin.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While dermatologists and estheticians are both skincare experts, they each have different wheelhouses of practice and services they provide. Ahead, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Sheila Farhang</a>, board-certified dermatologist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Ashley White</a>, licensed esthetician, and Sharlena Hassani, licensed esthetician and founder/CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Artisan of Skin</a>, break down the key differences, along with how to know who to see.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-a-dermatologist-and-what-does-it-take-to-become-one></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is a Dermatologist and What Does It Take To Become One?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A dermatologist is a medical doctor trained to diagnose and treat skin, hair, and nail conditions, over 3,000 conditions to be exact!" says Dr. Farhang. "In addition to general medical dermatology — eczema, acne, hair loss, rashes, skin cancer screening — dermatologists can sub-specialize in one or more fields such as cosmetics, Mohs micrographic skin cancer surgery, dermatopathology, and pediatrics."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dermatologists also participate in some sort of research and public writing during their training or throughout their career, and may even focus on the topics covered in these studies and papers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Some dermatologists are more dedicated to innovation, cutting edge technology, and technique and become thought leaders and key opinion leaders in the field," Dr. Farhang elaborates. "These thought leaders help develop and test out new products and technology including fillers and lasers as well as lecture other providers at conferences."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for training, dermatologists go through several years of schooling and residencies before they practice on actual patients. In addition to four years of college, four years of medical school, a one-year medical internship, and a three-year dermatology residency, Dr. Farhang says dermatologists need to "sit for and pass a final exam by the American Board of Dermatology (ABD) in order to be board-certified and may do an additional one to two years in cosmetics, Mohs micrographic skin cancer surgery, pediatric dermatology, and dermatopathology." Dermatologists also have to maintain their certification through the ABD's maintenance of certification program.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-should-you-see-a-dermatologist></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When Should You See a Dermatologist?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on your specific skin issues, you may need to go straight to a dermatologist. For example, MDs can diagnose skin lesions, new rashes and sensitivities, and perform annual skin checks to determine if any changing moles are of concern.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Farhang says dermatologists can also treat new and existing skin concerns that are worsening, such as cystic acne that's scarring, with prescription products. "Estheticians cannot diagnose medical-related skin lesions and are not able to write prescriptions such as those for acne or melasma (e.g. prescription strength retinoids)," she explains. "They are also limited with the depth or strength of their chemical peels."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They can also determine whether these concerns are symptoms of another medical issue, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid disorders. "If patients are experiencing drastic texture changes or hair loss, a dermatologist may need to rule out thyroid issues or diagnosis associated scalp issues or autoimmune hair loss."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-an-esthetician-and-what-goes-into-becoming-one></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is an Esthetician and What Goes Into Becoming One?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Estheticians are licensed professionals who can legally perform facials, hair removal, makeup application, and other treatments that cosmetically enhance the outermost layer of the epidermis," says White.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The exact requirements for estheticians vary from state to state, but generally, estheticians must undergo at least 400 hours of training, graduate from an accredited esthetics school, and pass a two-section state board exam, plus pay all fees required by the state.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The first section is written, with the second being practical. The written portion of the exam really depends on the state, as each state's laws are different," Hassani says. "Questions are rather diverse but generally will take into account state laws, safety and health issues, skin conditions and disorders, how to analyze ingredients and skin care procedures. Once you pass the written exam, you can then schedule the practical exam."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-does-an-esthetician-do-and-when-should-you-see-one></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Does an Esthetician Do and When Should You See One?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Estheticians provide non-medical skincare services such as facials (including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>extractions</a>), microdermabrasion, and peels, depending on the state they practice in. "In general, estheticians are trained in non-prescription topical skin care and basic anatomy with the opportunity to learn additional science that may be beyond their scope of practice," White says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once a dermatologist has diagnosed your skincare conditions or you have specific concerns you'd like to address in your routine, an esthetician can help you create a regimen. "Estheticians should be seen when you are trying to build a skincare routine, alleviate a range of acne and superficial concerns or enrich the overall appearance of your skin," White explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The biggest difference between what we do and what dermatologists do is we are trainers for the skin, helping clients with their skin maintenance by doing resurfacing peels to renew and train the skin to function better on its own on a day-to-day basis and helping clients with their at-home maintenance routines for overall skin health," Hassani adds. "Dermatologists are doctors that come into play when there's something needing a prescription (like Accutane) or a medical treatment like lasers, injectables, and complicated scar revision treatments. Dermatologists are also there to handle medical conditions like eczema, psoriasis, skin cancer and perform cosmetic procedures like injections, fillers, and botox."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-dermatologists-and-estheticians-work-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do Dermatologists and Estheticians Work Together?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on the situation of your skin, your dermatologist may recommend you also see an esthetician or vice versa. "A <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>chemical peel</a> or microdermabrasion [can be] performed by an esthetician while treating and managing them medically," Dr. Farhang says. "While dermatology offices can offer facials, the dermatologist is usually not the one performing it and can refer out to a trusted esthetician or many dermatology offices have an in-house esthetician."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">White adds that a smart esthetician knows their limitations and when to refer clients to a dermatologist in order to achieve the best outcome. "I refer clients to my dermatologist for hair loss/scalp concerns, nodules, rashes, and yearly skin checks in addition to monthly services with me for a holistic approach to their overall skin health," she says. "Estheticians can also work directly under the provision of a dermatologist, assisting them with skin analyses and non-invasive services."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1om56qnZbBsLjOoKCsrF2rwG6x0q2fnqyZmLaiuoydoJ%2Belaeyr6%2FE</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdermatologist-vs-esthetician-difference.html&text=Dermatologist%20vs.%20Esthetician%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Difference%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdermatologist-vs-esthetician-difference.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdermatologist-vs-esthetician-difference.html&title=Dermatologist%20vs.%20Esthetician%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Difference%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdermatologist-vs-esthetician-difference.html&title=Dermatologist%20vs.%20Esthetician%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Difference%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdermatologist-vs-esthetician-difference.html&title=Dermatologist%20vs.%20Esthetician%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Difference%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdermatologist-vs-esthetician-difference.html&description=Dermatologist%20vs.%20Esthetician%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Difference%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-baby-name-phineas-meaning.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Justin Timberlake, Jessica Biel Baby Name Meaning: Phineas">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./danielle-campbell-boyfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danielle Campbell Boyfriend &amp;amp; Dating History">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
