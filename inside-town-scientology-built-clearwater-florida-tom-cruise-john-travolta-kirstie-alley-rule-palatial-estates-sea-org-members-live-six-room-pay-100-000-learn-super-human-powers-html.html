It eventually led to the arrest and conviction of the top ten people in Scientology including Hubbard's wife Mary. Hubbard himself escaped arrest and went into hiding for the last ten years of his life in the desert.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Bunker and the Church have been clashing for years and it even got an injunction against him in 1999, which stated that he and any Scientologist had to be more than ten feet away from each other. Mark claims that he's been followed by Scientology for years and they even distributed flyers around his neighborhood.</span></p><img id=i-f38b3607e7380db4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/31/17/271B8A5500000578-3015144-The_bus_station_for_the_Church_s_Flag_Buses_which_ferry_Sea_Org_-a-42_1427821159732.jpg height=637 width=962 alt="The bus station for the Church's 'Flag Buses', which ferry Sea Org members around town" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The bus station for the Church's 'Flag Buses', which ferry Sea Org members around town</p><img id=i-c519c599d2e30b7a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/31/17/271B8B1500000578-3015144-The_entrance_to_the_Scientology_retreat_called_Sandcastle-a-45_1427821159925.jpg height=637 width=962 alt="The entrance to the Scientology retreat called Sandcastle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The entrance to the Scientology retreat called Sandcastle</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'The people of Clearwater don't want to come downtown, it's the furthest thing from warm and welcoming.

If they're suspicious of you, then they're going to follow you home to find out why you dared to take a picture of their building,' says&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'On my cell phone, I have the camera ready in case Scientology are following me, I've heard from people that they have private investigators parked down my street.

I feel this is a good time to stick my nose in and stand up at city council meetings to say how Scientology is affecting people around the world and all the actions are being directed from Clearwater. People should be outraged by it and not make it easier for them to do this. Potentially down the road, I'll run for political office myself.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><br></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKAcX2UamttZ3mjwKqwxGarqK%2BeYqCktcSnq6ikn5zGbq7UoqOtZXOhsqK%2B1pqrnqpde7mwvsidmGaMn6J6hL7UoqqeZXqkta95s6uYr6ecqa5ul8irqq2hlWKOrbjEsmSrrZyaerGty5qropmcYrK0wMCtnKxlg5qubpvRoGSmnZ2XsrO%2FjKWgr51dqLa5edGopqZloJbGbn2PaWRpaGBiuaat0adkrK2gmr9utNSmmKdloKTEpr7SZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-town-scientology-built-clearwater-florida-tom-cruise-john-travolta-kirstie-alley-rule-palatial-estates-sea-org-members-live-six-room-pay-100-000-learn-super-human-powers-html.html&text=Scientology%20town%20Clearwater%20where%20members%20pay%20%24100k%20to%20learn%20super%20human%20powers&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-town-scientology-built-clearwater-florida-tom-cruise-john-travolta-kirstie-alley-rule-palatial-estates-sea-org-members-live-six-room-pay-100-000-learn-super-human-powers-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-town-scientology-built-clearwater-florida-tom-cruise-john-travolta-kirstie-alley-rule-palatial-estates-sea-org-members-live-six-room-pay-100-000-learn-super-human-powers-html.html&title=Scientology%20town%20Clearwater%20where%20members%20pay%20%24100k%20to%20learn%20super%20human%20powers" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-town-scientology-built-clearwater-florida-tom-cruise-john-travolta-kirstie-alley-rule-palatial-estates-sea-org-members-live-six-room-pay-100-000-learn-super-human-powers-html.html&title=Scientology%20town%20Clearwater%20where%20members%20pay%20%24100k%20to%20learn%20super%20human%20powers" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-town-scientology-built-clearwater-florida-tom-cruise-john-travolta-kirstie-alley-rule-palatial-estates-sea-org-members-live-six-room-pay-100-000-learn-super-human-powers-html.html&title=Scientology%20town%20Clearwater%20where%20members%20pay%20%24100k%20to%20learn%20super%20human%20powers" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-town-scientology-built-clearwater-florida-tom-cruise-john-travolta-kirstie-alley-rule-palatial-estates-sea-org-members-live-six-room-pay-100-000-learn-super-human-powers-html.html&description=Scientology%20town%20Clearwater%20where%20members%20pay%20%24100k%20to%20learn%20super%20human%20powers" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tim-allen-richard-karn-assembly-required-show-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tim Allen &amp;amp; Richard Karn Are Teaming Up for a New Competition Show Called 'Assembly Required'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./preeti-agarwal-automotive-cybersecurity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Preeti Agarwal | Addressing Automotive Cybersecurity">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
