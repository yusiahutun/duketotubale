Furthermore, they also have two children Solo Uniacke, born on May 6, 2012, and Atom Uniacke, born on December 2, 2014. He is known as a Sinophile, who talks to their children in Chinese almost exclusively. According to his partner, Solo could translate Chinese for her during their visits to Beijing even at the young age of four.</p><h4><span>Previous Marriages</span></h4><p>As he had previously failed marriages, her girlfriend also had failed relations previously. She dated an actor, Simon Woods for the first time. But they separated after dating for a couple of years and Simon came out as gay. Later, she dated the director, Joe Wright. Even they separated after an alleged fallout over ‘pre-wedding postcards’.</p><p>Then after she finally met him and they’ve been in a relationship since then. Talking about him, Rosamund said once that he is “the most interesting person I’ve ever come across”. She also said that he is very “articulate and ruthless” about the roles she takes on. He also often helps in keeping in check her tendency to “imagine there is more on the page than there is”.</p><p>He has been on international media for issues including his past as a drug addict to his two failed marriages. Everything has surfaced in the media. Nevertheless, he has managed to keep a low profile except for some outings with his partner and their children.</p><h2><span id=Scandal>Scandal</span></h2><p>Robie has been through many controversies. There was a controversy that he was a drug addict previously and had been taken to rehab several times. However, in the present time, he is not part of any controversy.</p><p>In 2018, he was banned from his position in the company for four years. He had to deal with this situation after he failed to pay $250k to the taxman. Just as Rosamund’s new film ‘Entebbe’ hit the theatres in May 2018, he, unfortunately, got entangled in financial issues as Dailymail UK reported. It said that he had been disqualified as a company director. It was after he admitted to several offenses during the investigation into the collapse of his company Pale Fire Ltd.</p><p>Furthermore, he also admitted to not paying HMRC since July 2012, although he received £260,508 in his account during the next couple of years. Moreover, he used £144,060 of that money for his personal use, £10,514 on mobile phones, and £25,154 on other payments and bank charges. These are all according to his statement.</p><p>Moreover, he is well-profiled and also a sober man at present. Currently, there are no rumors regarding his personal and professional life.</p><h2><span id=Robie_Uniacke_8211_Body_Measurements>Robie Uniacke – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Talking about Robie Uniacke’s body measurements, Robie Uniacke has an amazing personality.
