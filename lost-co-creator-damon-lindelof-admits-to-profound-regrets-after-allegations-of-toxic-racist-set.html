He said he went into it believing there would be "equitable" screen time for the main cast.</p><p>That shifted, though, as some of the characters started to move toward the forefront, with him not among them. "It became pretty clear that I was the Black guy, <a href=#>Daniel [Dae Kim</a>, Jin] was the Asian guy, and then you had Jack [<a href=#>Matthew Fox</a>] and Kate [<a href=#>Evangeline Lily</a>] and Sawyer [<a href=#>Josh Holloway</a>]."</p><p>A writer told Ryan that they were told repeatedly the "hero characters" were indeed Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Locke (<a href=#>Terry O'Quinn</a>), all of them white. Perrineau said that when he raised his concerns, he was told these characters were more "relatable." Further, the writer recalled hearing, "Nobody cares about these other characters. Just give them a few scenes on another beach."</p><p>The "Oz" alum also said that he took issue with how one of the show's earliest mysteries was handled after his son on the show, Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) was kidnapped. As he saw it, the show's lack of follow-through on that narrative, and Michael's lack of focus on his missing son, was "furthering the narrative that nobody cares about Black boys, even Black fathers."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e9edba7e-2b59-4ba3-b3ed-052d3c04e8fb data-container-ref=toofab:article:40684fb8-c024-4d8b-8c0c-476ea2b95e54 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/16/5by4/2023/05/16/1686e2fc9a0f40608907d67bbb687ffa_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">HBO</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">The Weeknd Responds to 'Ridiculous' Claims 'The Idol' Set Was a Total 'S---show'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>At the time, it was largely believed that the creators struggled with what to do with Walt because Kelley grew so dramatically. While filming took place over years, time was moving much slower on the island, making his sudden growth spurt problematic to explain. Cuse confirmed this, saying it was a problem they "did not know how to solve."</p><p>At the same time, Lindelof acknowledged there was "a high degree of insensitivity" toward the Black stereotypes Perrineau would try to bring up and combat. Ultimately, the friction between actor and co-creator would lead to Perrineau being unceremoniously written off the show after the second season.</p><p>Perinneau said he had expressed script concerns about his character's storylines, as well as what he saw as a lack of complexlty for his character. He told Lindelof and co-creator Carlton Cuse, "If you're going to use me, let's work. I'm here to work. I'm good at my job and I'll do anything you want. Except be 'the Black guy' on your show."</p><p>He was lashing out in particular over the fact that the first scripts for the episode where Walt was kidnapped had Sawyer flashbacks instead of Michael and/or Walt flashbacks. After his complaint, the flashbacks were changed but he said he "felt like suddenly they were mad at me."</p><p>Then he said that he was told he would not be asked back for Season 3. According to Perrineau, Cuse told him, "Well, you know, you said to us, if we don't have anything good for you, you want to go." Perrineau said he was "just asking for equal depth."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ecb1c502-fcc2-482d-9d73-95ea91f7daaf data-container-ref=toofab:article:40684fb8-c024-4d8b-8c0c-476ea2b95e54 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2e/5by4/2023/05/28/2ecc2dd7584d4fdd8d4819f908837fa1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kelly Clarkson on Why Talk Show Is Moving to New York, '100 Percent' Her Idea</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>According to Ryan's book, other sources from the production claimed that Lindelof said of Perrineau's exit from the show, he "called me racist, so I fired his a--." Lindelof said he didn't recall "ever" saying that, and that "it breaks my heart that that was Harold's experience."</p><p>"I'll just cede that the events you're describing happened 17 years ago, and I don't know why anybody would make that up about me," Lindelof said.</p><p>Of the litany of allegations of things said by himself or Cruse, Lindelof said he didn't want to dismiss them, but he legitimately didn't recall any of the specific things Ryan mentioned. "And that's not me saying that they didn't happen," he insisted. "I'm just saying that it's literally baffling my brain--that they did happen and that I bore witness to them or that I said them. To think that they came out of my mouth or the mouths of people that I still consider friends is just not computing."</p><p>He also noted that every actor in the ensemble "expressed some degree of disappointment that they weren't being used enough." At the same time, he had to concede one of Perrineau's points.</p><p>"There was a disproportionate amount of focus on Jack and Kate and Locke and Sawyer -- the white characters. Harold was completely and totally right to point that out," he said. "It's one of the things that I've had deep and profound regrets about in the two decades since."</p><p>"I do feel that Harold was legitimately and professionally conveying concerns about his character and how significant it was that Michael and Walt -- with the exception of Rose -- were really the only Black characters on the show," Lindelof added.</p><p>Cuse said that he wasn't present, and didn't hear any of the comments brought up by Ryan, but noted, "I deeply regret that anyone at 'Lost' would have to hear them. They are highly insensitive, inappropriate, and offensive."</p><a id=gallery-link-3c01f08b-ea18-45aa-8a3b-27c71b0caa28 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:3c01f08b-ea18-45aa-8a3b-27c71b0caa28 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:40684fb8-c024-4d8b-8c0c-476ea2b95e54 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f3/4by3/2023/05/30/f34dc12f13a44564b3b0350cc3c6220f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25mbGlfoby0wIycpmabopqutbvRZpuapZ%2Bjeq21zZ2cpaeWYq6lucitqmasn2K9s7vFqKynnF2nsqi%2BxK2qZpmWqbKzecClo56fkam2sLrSZqafZaSkxaqvjKuYnKGjqXq0sdNo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flost-co-creator-damon-lindelof-admits-to-profound-regrets-after-allegations-of-toxic-racist-set.html&text=Damon%20Lindelof%20Has%20%27Profound%20Regrets%27%20After%20Harold%20Perrineau%20Allegations%20of%20Toxic%2c%20Racist%20Lost%20Set&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flost-co-creator-damon-lindelof-admits-to-profound-regrets-after-allegations-of-toxic-racist-set.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flost-co-creator-damon-lindelof-admits-to-profound-regrets-after-allegations-of-toxic-racist-set.html&title=Damon%20Lindelof%20Has%20%27Profound%20Regrets%27%20After%20Harold%20Perrineau%20Allegations%20of%20Toxic%2c%20Racist%20Lost%20Set" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flost-co-creator-damon-lindelof-admits-to-profound-regrets-after-allegations-of-toxic-racist-set.html&title=Damon%20Lindelof%20Has%20%27Profound%20Regrets%27%20After%20Harold%20Perrineau%20Allegations%20of%20Toxic%2c%20Racist%20Lost%20Set" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flost-co-creator-damon-lindelof-admits-to-profound-regrets-after-allegations-of-toxic-racist-set.html&title=Damon%20Lindelof%20Has%20%27Profound%20Regrets%27%20After%20Harold%20Perrineau%20Allegations%20of%20Toxic%2c%20Racist%20Lost%20Set" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flost-co-creator-damon-lindelof-admits-to-profound-regrets-after-allegations-of-toxic-racist-set.html&description=Damon%20Lindelof%20Has%20%27Profound%20Regrets%27%20After%20Harold%20Perrineau%20Allegations%20of%20Toxic%2c%20Racist%20Lost%20Set" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./eva-longoria-black-dress-oscars-2024-8607001.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eva Longoria Wore a Goth Glam Gown and Diamonds at the 2024 Oscars">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1-records-announces-partnership-with-exceleration-music.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="+1 Records Announces Partnership With Exceleration Music">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
