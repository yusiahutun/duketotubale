It has been called Un-even yet admirably ambitious.</p><p>Prior to Violet, Batmen had written, directed, and produced a short film called Five Minutes, which she premiered at the 2017 International Film Festival held in Toronto.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-justine->What Happened To Justine Bateman's Face?</h2><p>There is nothing wrong with Justine Batemen's face in the cosmetic sense, but her fans are saddened that she is aging.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Bateman has not only embraced it but has written a book about aging called Face: One Square Foot of Skin, published by Akashic Books in 2021.</p><p>The book is a compilation of fictitious stories that explores how men and women have grown to believe that older women's looks are undesired, unsightly, and something that has to be changed out of fear and ingrained evolutionary patterns.</p><p>For example, Faith, a 48-year-old former advertising executive who appears as one of Bateman's characters, leans down and catches a glimpse of her face reflected on a tabletop.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/11/c20d3e73-744d-4ff7-a6b5-6280a3af66d1.webp></p><p>She is appalled by this fresh perception of her drooping skin.&nbsp; Although she was conscious that her face was no different than it had been an hour earlier, she was also aware that it had crossed over and couldn't undo it or stop her confidence from waning.</p><p>The book shows the reader the various underlying factors for society's frequently unfavorable opinions about women's older faces based on the author Justine Bateman's experiences with older faces and those of the other women and men she interviewed.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/11/aa77a30f-357b-4bdf-8554-bef23e8df166.webp></p><p>By doing this, Bateman challenges the widespread belief that older women's appearances must be fixed and urges us to stop valuing people according to how well their faces look.</p><p>Bateman makes the case that a woman's confidence should increase as she ages rather than being devastated by society's false perception of that one square foot of skin with passionate writing and a laser-sharp eye.</p><h2 id=who-is-justine-bateman-hu>Who Is Justine Bateman's Husband?</h2><p>Justine Bateman is married to<strong> Mark Fluent</strong>, the current Managing Director and Head of Western US Real Estate for Deutsche Bank.</p><p>Fluent oversees the Bank's Los Angeles, Dallas, and San Francisco offices. The couple married in 2001 and are based in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>According to various sources, though Fluent's exact net worth is unknown, they have estimated it to be above $3 million.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/11/8156177b-e162-4604-a368-7525bd2c7901.webp></p><p>A Managing Director makes an average annual salary of around $350,000, so Fluent probably makes around that amount.&nbsp;Fluent and Bateman have two children together. They have a daughter named Gianetta "Gia" Fluent and a son named Duke Kenneth.</p><p>The family is often spotted at events together, and Bateman posts them on her social media.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-justine-batem>Justine Bateman's Net Worth In 2022</h2><p>Justine Bateman is an American writer who has a net worth of<strong> $6 million </strong>as of 2022 through her various endeavors.</p><p>Bateman made her acting debut as the shallow Mallory Keaton in the comedy Family Ties when she was a teenager.</p><p>She retained the character throughout the show's run, which concluded in 1989. In 1988, she hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live during its 13th season.&nbsp;She received two Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe nomination for her performance on Family Ties.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/11/7807c59f-4818-4965-9dfe-d43639b6eb14.webp></p><p>She played Sarah, the girlfriend of Ron Eldard's character, in the 1996–1997 NBC American adaptation of the British TV comedy Men Behaving Badly, which featured Rob Schneider and Ron Eldard.&nbsp;With the 2003 Showtime miniseries Out of Order, which starred Eric Stoltz, Felicity Huffman, and William H. Macy, Bateman made a comeback to television.</p><p>Her character was initially thought to be Michael Bluth's sister in the episode "Family Ties," which aired in February 2006.</p><p>However, she is revealed to be a prostitute used by his father and pimped by his brother.</p><p>Jason Bateman, Bateman's brother in real life, played Michael Bluth.&nbsp;She also had recurring parts in series like Desperate Housewives, Still Standing, and Men in Trees.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/11/1c6cce7a-b989-4af0-ab50-5c630695c6b5.webp></p><p>Bateman played the title character in the movie Satisfaction in 1988.
