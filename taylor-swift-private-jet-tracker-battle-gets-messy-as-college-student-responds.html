Now, she has received a response from him.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift’s</a> lawyer Kate Wright Morrone sent the letter at the end of last year, writing the singer <a href=#>“lives in constant fear”</a> after Jack Sweeney began tracking where her plane went. He used social media apps like <a href=#>Instagram</a> to share the information but the accounts have now been suspended for “endangering her safety.” Taking to X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>) he shared the letter his attorney, James Slater, had sent in reply to Taylor Swift.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1474294754-1024x662.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-receives-reply-from-student-tracking-her-private-jet>Taylor Swift receives reply from student tracking her private jet</h2><p>On X, the 21-year-old quoted Tay Tay and penned: “Look What You Made Me Do,” quoting her track from 2017’s Reputation, with his lawyer’s letter attached.</p><p>In their reply, Sweeney and Slater write they believe no law was compromised by him tracking Taylor Swift on her private jet. The only one, they claim, the <a href=#>music</a> star mentioned was stalking. However, they say he has not made any “credible threats” towards her, so it wouldn’t uphold as a charge.</p><p>They wrote: “Put simply, there is nothing unlawful about GRNDCTRL’s use of publicly accessible information to track private jets, including those used by public figures like Taylor Swift. @taylorswiftjets<br>account is engaged in protected speech that does not violate any of Ms. Swift’s legal rights.</p><p>“Your letter makes that clear by failing to identify any legal claim. Only in a footnote to your December 22, 2023 letter do you flirt with asserting a stalking claim under California law-but the language just before the words you quote explains that a stalker is someone who makes a “credible threat” against a victim.”</p><p>They continued: “Our clients have never made any threats against Ms. Swift and your letter does not suggest they have done so. Further, your letter’s tone of alarm is unfounded.</p><p>“Our clients’ website only provides the location of private jets using publicly available information. That information poses no threat to Ms. Swift’s safety.</p><p>“We doubt Ms. Swift will pursue meritless legal action, but if she does, we will defend our clients’ rights.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-s-lawyer-pleaded-for-him-to-stop>Taylor’s lawyer pleaded for him to stop</h2><p>It comes after Taylor Swift sent Sweeney a cease and desist letter over him tracking her private jet last year. She claimed, through her lawyers, his public tracking of where she traveled made her “live in constant fear.”</p><p>He was told he “must stop” and it was “a life-or-death” situation for the Shake it Off songstress.</p><p>“You have engaged in stalking and harassing behavior, including consistently publishing real-time and precise information about our Client’s location and future whereabouts to the public on social media. This conduct poses an imminent threat to the safety and well-being of our Client and must stop.</p><p>“While this may be a game to you, or an avenue that you hope will earn you wealth or fame, it is a life-or-death matter for our Client. Ms. Swift has dealt with stalkers and other individuals who wish her harm since she was a teenager.</p><p>“This reality has forced our Client to live her life in a constant state of fear for her personal safety. That fear is and has been significantly heightened due to your reckless actions.”</p><p>Before the release of his lawyer’s response, Sweeney had said famous faces “should reasonably expect” they can be tracked via how they travel. He defended himself by saying the information is publicly available.</p><p>Sweeney has also had accounts tracking the flights of other <a href=#>celebrities</a> such as Kim Kardashian, Drake, and X’s owner Elon Musk. Musk took issue with the college student and threatened legal action as well.</p><p>His account tracking Musk was suspended (though Sweeney later opened a new one but tracked the business mogul with a 24-hour delay instead).</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2d%2BcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02anq6GmlsGmecmeq2asopawrLHRZpmarKShsm6zxK2qZqWVqMC6ecCsZJynnKGyqLGMrKuunJWjwW6%2BxKynqKaUqHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-private-jet-tracker-battle-gets-messy-as-college-student-responds.html&text=Taylor%20Swift%20private%20jet%20tracker%20battle%20gets%20messy%20as%20college%20student%20responds&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-private-jet-tracker-battle-gets-messy-as-college-student-responds.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-private-jet-tracker-battle-gets-messy-as-college-student-responds.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20private%20jet%20tracker%20battle%20gets%20messy%20as%20college%20student%20responds" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-private-jet-tracker-battle-gets-messy-as-college-student-responds.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20private%20jet%20tracker%20battle%20gets%20messy%20as%20college%20student%20responds" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-private-jet-tracker-battle-gets-messy-as-college-student-responds.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20private%20jet%20tracker%20battle%20gets%20messy%20as%20college%20student%20responds" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-private-jet-tracker-battle-gets-messy-as-college-student-responds.html&description=Taylor%20Swift%20private%20jet%20tracker%20battle%20gets%20messy%20as%20college%20student%20responds" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./white-supremacist-couple-kiss-smile-theyre-sentenced-life-killing-sex-offender-wife-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="White supremacist couple Jeremy and Christine Moody sentenced to life for killing sex offender">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pete-carroll-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pete Carroll Wife: Meet Glena Goranson">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
