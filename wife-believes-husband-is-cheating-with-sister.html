Later that night I was putting away dishes and I heard them murmuring in the kitchen, when I entered they hushed right away and looked flustered and started doing random stuff like putting away dirty dishes. Nothing really happened after this UNTIL yesterday so I just shrugged that whole thing off.</p><p>"Yesterday I was waiting for my husband in the car at Walmart because we really needed a new car seat for our daughter. As he left he made a phone call and it was for a moment, still connected to the bluetooth. The name that popped up on the screen was 'Steve' but I recognized the phone number. My heart dropped because that was my sisters number. When he got back I was like who were you talking on the phone with? And he said it was his boss, but his boss' name is Devon.</p><p>"I feel like I'm numb right now, I don't wanna make assumptions but I don't really know what to make of this?? I've just been doing errands all of today, I feel like I'm on autopilot/numb. How do I confront him? How can I confirm if I'm just not overthinking?</p><p>"I watch a looooot of true crime about husbands killing their wives for life insurance, and now I'm overthinking the fact that we just increased my life insurance policy literally a few months ago, my husband was pushing me to do it because apparently I make more money now and we need to make sure our daughter is taken care of if anything happens. I'm also overthinking the fact that I'm always feeling drowsy really often.</p><p>"Will really appreciate some input (am I overthinking?)"</p><h2 class=h2>The hasty update</h2><p>"A little too soon for an update," the woman wrote that same day, "but I'm so overwhelmed by the genuine advice and support from all of you. I've probably cried for about half the day today, my husband will be home shortly and to be honest I don't know how I'm going to explain my puffy eyes away."</p><p>"I've done lots of research today, but I need to digest everything and plan my move carefully. I've pretty much settled on the assumption that they are indeed cheating because I've accessed the phone records and to me, it told me all I needed to know. I'll try to update you guys when I can, but again thank you so much for all the advice and support, please know that I am not taking any of your suggestions lightly."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:cd8b8ec9-57a6-4464-8ea0-4a7fadda367a data-container-ref=toofab:article:0fd40681-926f-46d8-89ef-0d8b066d20ad data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9e/5by4/2023/09/05/9e780e8ddcda45d78945ecd0c1147e71_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Husband Abandons Wife During Connecting Flight for Being Late - And The Internet Is Taking His Side</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>However, she quickly backs away from the True Crime narrative</h2><p>In response to a commenter, the woman went on to clarify that the life insurance angle was most likely the result of paranoia surrounding an already difficult situation and likely not plausible.</p><p>"My husband has always been a good father and treats me right, does anything I ask him to do and takes care of me, which is why I can't wrap my head around something like this happening," she wrote. "My sister is also a really good person, so I don't think they will ever kill me but the life insurance thing is just at the back of my head bothering me. The payout is 1 million upon accidental death. Even today he noticed I've been acting a bit off, I just can't look him in the eye.."</p><p>She also pointed out, "My sister and I have always been really close, she babysits my daughter all the time."</p><p>But she did say she was still certain of some form of infidelity, "If my gut is correct I think they are going to deny it... so I'm trying to collect my thoughts and try to get actual evidence or look through my husbands phone."</p><h2 class=h2>Response</h2><p>Most of the commenters believed she was right in being suspicious of an affair but were less certain she had anything to fear when it came to the life insurance policy.</p><p>However, many of the Redditors did advise her to hire a private investigator if she was truly concerned about infidelity.</p><p>What do you think?</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:76ca55e7-7f8a-4b73-89f0-f483e64b6688 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0fd40681-926f-46d8-89ef-0d8b066d20ad data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/64/5by4/2023/08/16/64c42c0a26fe4418b08faaf6864f4906_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dying Wife Asks Husband If She Can Have Sex with Her Ex One Last Time, Redditor Says</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3JmaXBfrLansYybnKWhlauytHnHrqqbmZ6Zeqq%2FjJyfnpmknruoedaiq6Flo57AtbHRaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwife-believes-husband-is-cheating-with-sister.html&text=Wife%20Believes%20Husband%20Is%20Cheating%20With%20Sister&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwife-believes-husband-is-cheating-with-sister.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwife-believes-husband-is-cheating-with-sister.html&title=Wife%20Believes%20Husband%20Is%20Cheating%20With%20Sister" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwife-believes-husband-is-cheating-with-sister.html&title=Wife%20Believes%20Husband%20Is%20Cheating%20With%20Sister" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwife-believes-husband-is-cheating-with-sister.html&title=Wife%20Believes%20Husband%20Is%20Cheating%20With%20Sister" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwife-believes-husband-is-cheating-with-sister.html&description=Wife%20Believes%20Husband%20Is%20Cheating%20With%20Sister" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-megalyn-echikunwoke-married-know-about-her-husband-or-a-boyfriend-including-her-dating-history-and-affairs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gorgeous Megalyn Echikunwoke is dating Chris Rock: Couple of 12 months is rumored to be engaged">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./guildford-city-fc-11-football-club-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Guildford City FC: 11 Football Club Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
