It is responsible for giving hair its colour. But when the melanocyte activity slows down, it can cause greying. Melanocyte activity usually slows down because of things like ageing, hormonal fluctuations, genetic predisposition, poor nutrition, thyroid disorders, harmful hair care products, exposure to the sun’s UV rays, and stress.</p><p class=align-left>If you have black hair, managing it is even more challenging, whether it is in its chemically relaxed or natural state. That is because it has its specific needs, especially when it comes to ensuring enough moisture content. Moisture is crucial to black hair because of its distinctive texture. It nourishes it to help it grow and stay healthy. One natural way of nourishing the hair is to use a mixture of lemon juice and coconut oil.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fc2039c03a360238.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best oils for hair growth for black hair</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Why you should keep natural hair</p><h2>Can I mix coconut oil with lemon juice?</h2><p class=align-left>You can mix coconut oil and lemon juice to get a solution packed with citric acid, lauric acid, vitamin B complex, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">flavonoids</a>. All these elements are crucial to the growth and health of black hair. They can also stop premature greying and prevent an oily scalp.</p><h2>Is lemon good for grey hair?</h2><p class=align-left>People have used lemon for a long time as a homemade and natural hair care remedy. Some hair masks and oils also contain lemon. It helps to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fight dandruff</a> and promotes hair growth. Lemon is also useful for repressing premature greying of black hair. Furthermore, it has anti-fungal properties that prevent the scalp from getting infections.</p><h2>Can grey hair be reversed naturally?</h2><p class=align-left>Many people know that grey hair is a natural sign of ageing or genetics. While both factors are correct, it is possible to slow down and even reverse the greying process using natural remedies. But to do that, you first need to understand how greying occurs.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a2658e9d2dd3f342.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to take care of Brazilian weave</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As noted above, melanocytes are the pigment cells in the hair follicles that give it its colour. When the body stops producing melanin, the hair starts turning grey. But researchers have also discovered that greying is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">build-up of hydrogen peroxide</a> in hair particles. The chemical bleaches the hair from the inside, hence discolouring it.</p><p class=align-left>Usually, it is the catalase enzyme that breaks down the hydrogen peroxide produced in the body into oxygen and water. But as a person ages, the production of the enzyme slows down. As a result, hydrogen peroxide accumulates in the body. It will bleach out the pigment centres of the hair and discolour it. In simple terms, the low production of the catalase enzyme will cause greying.</p><h2>Can coconut oil and lemon juice reverse gray hair?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fc2039c03a360238.jpg><p class=align-left>Naturally, coconut oil and lemon juice for grey hair is an excellent combination that can reverse greying. When applied on the scalp, the vitamins and minerals found in the solution will cleanse the scalp of sebum build-up. They will also stimulate proper blood flow, restore hair shafts, and regenerate new follicles.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/83c96cd66268753e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 must-have African hair accessories for black women</span></p></a><h2>Do coconut oil and lemon juice get rid of grey hair?</h2><p class=align-left>Coconut oil and lemon juice are two excellent ingredients that can get rid of grey hair. That is possible because of the following reasons:</p><h3>1. Act as moisturisers</h3><p class=align-left>Your hair is likely to go grey if it lacks moisture. When combined, lemon juice and coconut oil for grey hair provide moisture to the hair. Black hair is particularly at risk because its natural texture makes it weak in holding onto enough moisture to keep it supple, healthy, and even grow.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Advantages of co-washing your natural hair</p><p class=align-left>Your hair needs moisture so that it can penetrate the shaft. So, when you mix the two solutions, they will lock in moisture in the shaft and allow healthy hair to grow. That will also prevent premature greying.</p><h3>2. Has lots of minerals and vitamins</h3><p class=align-left>Coconut oil has high concentrations of saturated fatty acids, vitamins E and K, capric acid, and lauric acid. When unprocessed, the oil has lots of moisture-retaining properties. It does not evaporate or even break down easily when you apply to the hair.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/444585f3c6762d0f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>7 natural alternatives to black hair dye without chemicals</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Similarly, lemon juice has lots of vitamin C, vitamin B complex, flavonoids, and citric acid. These elements help to hydrate, nourish, and repair hair shafts. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vitamin B-6</a> helps restore hair to its original colour after a deficiency or illness. In general, a deficiency of vitamins D, E, B-6, B-12, and biotin will cause premature greying.</p><h3>3. Stimulates hair re-growth</h3><p class=align-left>Lemon juice is rich in Vitamin C. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vitamin C</a> is an antioxidant that helps to protect the hair against oxidative stress caused by free radicals. The body needs the vitamin to create collagen. Collagen is a protein that plays an essential role in the structure of human hair.</p><p class=align-left>Also, it helps the body to absorb iron, which is a mineral needed for hair growth. So, by using lemon juice, this will stimulate hair re-growth from dormant follicles. By boosting collagen production, this will improve the rate at which the hair grows.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ed7fbd3effd5e219.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Caramel skin tone: pictures, maintenance, best hair colors, celebrities</span></p></a><h3>4. Act as natural conditioners</h3><p class=align-left>Coconut oil has a lot of fatty acids. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lauric acid</a>, for example, helps to seal back the hair. It locks in the nutrients and keeps pollutants out. In turn, the nutrients will strengthen the hair shaft and prevent split ends, hair loss, and breakage. As a natural conditioner, coconut oil and gray hair will also reduce yeast levels on the scalp, which often leads to dandruff.</p><p class=align-left>Also, lemon juice helps to unclog the pores on hair follicles. That is useful in reducing dandruff. The presence of dandruff on the hair is usually a result of a dirty scalp and fungal infections. But dandruff can also form because of the presence of hydrogen peroxide in the hair. Thus, it will bleach the hair and cause greying.</p><h3>5. Prevents an oily scalp</h3><p class=align-left>When you have an oily scalp, it is usually a result of over-reactive sebaceous glands. The oil will attract dirt and produce dandruff. It will make the hair stick together and even clog hair roots. That will cause excessive dandruff, hair loss, and even greying.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/640cb6baff7a2eca.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>3C hair: Texture, styling, care routine, moisturing, products</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Many coconut oil and lemon juice for grey hair Snopes reviews suggest that lemon juice has citric acid. The citric acid helps to remove the excess production of oil on the scalp.
