Moreover, Jordan’s rocking voice and amusing guitar skills have got recognition from thousands of people. By 2021, Jordan will have completed two decades of his time in the music industry.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>Jordan’s educational history does not seem to align with his career. Also, Jordan has never revealed his qualification in detail. However, it has come to light that Jordan attended Elite School and Greenhill School during childhood. As for his undergraduate studies, Dr. Phil’s son attended the University of Texas at Austin to obtain a BSc degree in Psychology.</p><p>Though it may seem that Jordan was following his father’s footsteps, we can now see that he had interests in music rather than psychology. Also, Jordan is not a licensed psychologist.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Jordan McGraw, the veteran singer, began his career at the early age of 15. At that time, Jordan loved playing guitar, though it was merely a hobby. After believing his music talent, Jordan started his first band, <a href=#>Upside</a>, in 2005, where Jordan was the group’s lead guitarist and vocalist.</p><p>After five years at Upside, Jordan established a famous organization named Organica Music Group (OMG). Furthermore, Jordan was OMG’s A&R vice-president, and during his time at OMG, Jordan collaborated with other artists, including Margo Rey and Crystal Harris. Jordan also had the role of writing lyrics for OMG’s division.</p><p>Apart from OMG, Jordan was also a lead guitarist for a band called Stars in Stereo for five straight years in Los Angeles, California. From Stars in Stereo, Jordan became the <a href=#>Hundred Handed</a> band’s vocalist.</p><p>Finally, Jordan’s career started getting recognition as the band’s debut single song became viral across rock music fans. Hundred Handed began releasing many other pieces until the band separated.</p><p>Following the band’s separation, Jordan went on to become a solo artist just like other members. Jordan’s major solo works were one of the opening acts in Jonas Brothers Happiness Tour and a solo debut album, <a href=#>Flexible</a>. Similarly, the “Flexible” album was released on the 1st of April of 2019, which has over 1 million views on YouTube.</p><h2>Jordan McGraw Net Worth and House</h2><p>Following the rock star’s engagement to <strong>Morgan Stewart</strong>, a TV celebrity, Jordan now owns a beautiful house in Beverly Hills.
