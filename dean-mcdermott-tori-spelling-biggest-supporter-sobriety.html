"She just wants me to be happy -- bottom line -- she’s such an incredible woman that way."</p><p>The 32-year-old said the Beverly Hills, 90210 star is "one of the most generous people" he's ever encountered, calling her a "caring, empathetic" person, who wants the best for everybody."</p><p>"Sometimes at the expense of her happiness, which is not good as we know. But that’s the kind of person she is," added McDermott, who shares kids Liam, 16, Stella, 15, Hattie, 12, Finn, 11, and Beau, 7, with Spelling.</p><p>The former Chopped Canada host also expressed his gratitude toward his girlfriend, Lily Calo, for being a "great support" for him.

"The way I was running my life, the way I was running the show was not right. Not, good for anybody -- myself, my family and Tori [Spelling]. It was a horrible way to live. So I finally surrendered and asked for help, and I got it."</p><p>McDermott and Spelling's marital troubles came to light with a breakup statement back in June, with him later admitting that it is almost entirely a result of his alcoholism.</p><p>The Open Range star told Page Six that he "went into treatment and put [his] life back together," crediting his new sober lifestyle to his time at the Harmony Place Treatment Center in Woodland Hills, California, and Freedom House Sober Living in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>"It's amazing when we ask -- it's a simple thing, but very difficult to do when you’re at the end of your rope and don't know where to turn," McDermott said, recalling that he told himself to go all in at "100 percent."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:08b26ce8-819b-44be-bba9-f4b976e408c2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2509ae07-b969-434a-afeb-67cdd29fe458 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/06/5by4/2023/11/17/067fdc128f9e471182043b518377ca9c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dean McDermott Details Drunken Raging at Tori Spelling & Kids That Led to Suicide Attempt</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Coming in at 55 years old -- it's just not a good look. I had to get this right," he added.</p><p>The father of six shared that he was in treatment six days a week, which included four groups a day. McDermott said his breathwork group "changed [his] life" after the "very first session."</p><p>After he became sober, he added a new role to his resume: alcohol and drug counselor. McDermott revealed he works to help others who are going through similar journeys, including being a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>facilitator for Conscious Community Global.</strong></a></p><p>"I work in recovery today because of my experience, in treatment and sober living," McDermott said. "I'm an alcohol and drug counselor, and I work with other treatment centers. I work with alcoholics and addicts and help them find the path, that I found and the one that I’m on now. It’s incredibly rewarding."</p><p>Describing alcohol as a "horrible drug," he added that he encourages those who are struggling to find the courage to seek help and understand that they are "worth it."</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, <strong>get help</strong>.
