Georgette Falcone comes after what her dad and mum do on TV as an actress and actress, and there is no doubt why she performs so well as a child or is ready to take over the film industry as an adult.</p><p>She is still very young, but after her debut film, she makes enthusiastic. Both people and her fans have started to ask some general and more personal questions about her. To answer these questions, we will inform you about her biography, her family, and her boyfriend and provide some interesting facts about the talented Georgette Falcone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Georgette Falcone Biography (Age)</strong></h2><p>Georgette has her birth sign as Aquarius, she was born 3 days before Valentine’s Day exactly on February 11th of the year 2010 as a daughter of her parents and an older sibling, who is 2 years older than her.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who is Elizabeth Banks Husband, What’s Her Net Worth? Bio and Quick Facts</a></strong></p><p>She still goes to school, but it is not known at which school she was enrolled or maybe she is taught at home. However, we expect more information about her to be published over time and as she grows older, or she will probably give a detailed account of what it was like for her to grow up. At the moment we know that she is doing quite well with her parents and older sister.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Georgette Falcone’s Family – Parents and Siblings</strong></h2><p>Little Georgette was born as the daughter of the parents of the famous actor Ben Falcone and the actress Melissa McCarthy, dad and mum. She has an older sister named Vivian Falcone, who was born in May 2007. Like her sister, she is also an aspiring actress, although still at a very young age.</p><p>Her mother is a famous American actress who has talents for other things and is also active in comedy, as a writer, fashion designer, and film producer.</p><p>Georgette’s father is not left out of the limelight as expected, birds of the same feather flock together. He is a well-educated, talented and professional actor, film director, and creative screenwriter.</p><p>The father and mother of the young celebrity actress Georgette were together for 2 years before they got married on October 8, 2005. The couple lives in their home in Los Angeles, California, with their two lovely children who made their debut in the film they made: The Boss in 2016. Georgette appeared as one of the young girls working in the brownie company run by her mother.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Zoe Saldana Bio, Husband, Kids, Parents, Net Worth, Age and Height</a></strong></p><p>Georgette ventured into acting after hearing that her sister Vivian was in The Boss. She insisted on acting as well and her parents allowed her to and were amazed at how impressive she was. If you have parents who are masters of the film industry, you can now get a better idea of the quality and quantity of the acting genes that Georgette carries within her. This shows why, despite her young age, she knew how to portray all the scenes she played in the movie The Boss.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>eonline.com</a> Falcone is said to have said that “they haven’t asked for more work – at least not yet”. “We’ll see what happens,” he said. “I won’t discourage them, but I won’t encourage them.” Maybe it’ll be after college before we see her in a movie again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Does&nbsp;</strong><strong>Georgette&nbsp;</strong><strong>have a Boyfriend?</strong></h2><p>She’s very young and it would be strange to hear news of her being associated with boys. Georgette doesn’t have a boyfriend yet, and she’s probably not expected to have a boyfriend either, as she’s getting much older.</p><p>At the moment we believe she is still concentrating on her education and will probably pursue her acting career (if she wants to continue) under the guardianship of her parents, who know about acting.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Facts About Georgette Falcone</strong></h2><ul><li>Georgette was born on 11 February 2010</li><li>She is of American nationality by birth and Caucasian by ethnicity</li><li>Her father comes from an Italian background while her mother has&nbsp;Scottish descent</li><li>She has an elder sister Vivian Falcone who inspired her acting debut</li><li>Her parents, as well as the elder sister, are all actresses and an actor respectively</li><li>She acted alongside professional actresses and actors like Melissa McCarthy (mum), Kristen Bell, and Peter Dinklage in the 2016 movie,&nbsp;The Boss</li><li>Georgette has blonde hair and brown eyes</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ktKa70aCcrayVYrOiuMKopZ5lkp68bq3GnmSpmaKau7W%2FjKygm6SZo7S0ecWapKKkqWKvsMXFq6CeppRis6Kv06xm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgeorgette-falcone-bio-age-parents-siblings-family-boyfriend-facts.html&text=Georgette%20Falcone%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Parents%2c%20Siblings%2c%20Family%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Facts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeorgette-falcone-bio-age-parents-siblings-family-boyfriend-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeorgette-falcone-bio-age-parents-siblings-family-boyfriend-facts.html&title=Georgette%20Falcone%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Parents%2c%20Siblings%2c%20Family%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgeorgette-falcone-bio-age-parents-siblings-family-boyfriend-facts.html&title=Georgette%20Falcone%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Parents%2c%20Siblings%2c%20Family%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgeorgette-falcone-bio-age-parents-siblings-family-boyfriend-facts.html&title=Georgette%20Falcone%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Parents%2c%20Siblings%2c%20Family%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeorgette-falcone-bio-age-parents-siblings-family-boyfriend-facts.html&description=Georgette%20Falcone%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Parents%2c%20Siblings%2c%20Family%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jameela-jamil-bright-orange-hair.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jameela Jamil Just Dyed Her Hair Bright Orange">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./driver-harasses-boat-with-gay-pride-flag-instantly-regrets-it.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Driver Harasses Boat With Gay Pride Flag, Instantly Regrets It">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
