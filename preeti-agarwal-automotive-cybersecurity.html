By honoring her and her accomplishments, our magazine lays the foundation for future generations to flourish in an inclusive society where everyone, irrespective of gender, can pursue excellence.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Behind the Wheel to Protect Roads</h2><p>From Agra to America, Preeti’s professional journey has been exhilarating and packed with valuable insights. Transitioning from a Software expert to an entrepreneur, she is now deeply passionate about leading a team of innovators dedicated to creating safe and secure mobility solutions for all. Early in her career, she was very concerned about the growing automotive cyber-attacks and recognizing the vulnerability of vehicles in an era of rapid technological advancement across industries. With vehicles increasingly interconnected internally and to their surroundings, Preeti Agarwal understood the growing risks of cyber threats. This realization led her to co-found SecureThings alongside her partner Vishal Bajpai, with the mission of safeguarding the future of mobility and ensuring a safer driving experience for everyone.</p><p>As the Co-Founder & CTO of SecureThings, Preeti Agarwal has played an integral role in the company’s inception and subsequent successes.

Their mission transcended mere security; they aimed to adopt a proactive stance, always two steps ahead of potential hackers. Secure from design to deployment.&nbsp; However, at in the beginning, the hurdle was the reluctance of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to share proprietary data thus making the dream of ‘Born Secure’ vehicles difficult to achieve for Preeti and her team. Most OEMs were entrenched in a reactive cybersecurity strategy that was limited only to software related threats or incidents. It was then that a revolutionary idea came to the founders of SecureThings. No one was talking about hardware security in 2017. This became the seed of innovation that led to a new path of bringing security into the very framework of automobiles.</p><p>Preeti Agarwal and her team embarked on a mission to shift OEMs towards proactive security measures that were designed into the vehicle’s core. They emphasized that security should not merely react to threats but be intrinsic, and predictive and based on intelligence.
