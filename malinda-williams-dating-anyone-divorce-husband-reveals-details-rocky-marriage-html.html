So, keep reading!</p><h2>The Failed Married Relationships of Malinda Williams:</h2><p>Malinda was formerly married to actor Mekhi Phifer. The two tied the knot back in 1999, and share a son named Omikaye Phifer. However, after four years of sharing a husband-wife relationship,&nbsp;they ended their marital relationship in 2003.</p><p><img alt height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/celebrity/Malina%20Williams%20and%20Mekhi%20Phifer.jpg width=500 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Caption: Malinda Williams with her former husband Mekhi Phifer and son&nbsp;Omikaye Phifer.</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: thejasminebrand.com <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The reason behind the demise of the relationship was said to be the unfaithfulness of Mekhi, but back in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>, Mekhi spoke about the relationship and how it died and ended in a divorce.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>When he was asked if getting married to Malinda at a young age affected his career, he said,</p><p>No it didn’t affect my career, it affected me and helped me learn a lot about myself. I was young, I was like 24 years old and that’s tough being that young in this business, where I was at in this business and being in a tumultuous relationship. Because you try to do the right thing, me and her have a son together.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Being in that kind of relationship and that jump in my career at that age, it was tough. I can’t front arguing at home and going through all of that because we were both young and with both our A-type personalities–but we’re really good peoples now.</p><p>We’re better off, like we’re happily divorced, we’re better off friends and we’re raising our son together now but at the time it was crazy. For a lack of a better term, you’re traveling and girls are throwing it at you and sometimes your catching it.</p><p>Similarly, when he was asked if he cheated on Malinda the whole time, he responded saying, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Not the whole time but you know we were only married for less than a year. Then there was a point because I bought us a house and we were living on opposite sides of the house. We were technically married but you’re going two or three days living in the house and you aren’t even talking to, you talking about walking up and down the stairs past each other and you aren’t even talking. Then you got out in the world and you have your own group of friends and she has her peoples and you just become separate.</p><p>Moreover, when asked if it was a bad break up, he answered,</p><p>Yeah and no, I was kind of relived. I had developed this bald spot in the back of my hair because I was stressed and I didn’t even know it was stress. But once we got separated and I didn’t make it hard, I left her with the house and all of that and just left. I left with my clothes and my whip so then I was cool. But I guess she was still affected by it, she did this whole Honey article.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Malinda always called Mekhi a cheater and an adulterer. Mekhi also addressed the matter and divulged, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Yeah but there was no proof of that.</p><p>So there you have it, folks, it was quite a&nbsp;tumultuous relationship, to say the least, and after he split with Malinda, Mekhi then married&nbsp;Reshelet Barnes.</p><p>Malinda and Mekhi are said to be good friends now as they are co-parents to their son.</p><p>Also, following her divorce with Mekhi, Malinda then married famous DJ/Photographer D-Nice. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The two married one another in&nbsp;August 2008 and after months of celebrating their first anniversary, the two <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">separated </a>in October 2009.</p><p><img alt height=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/celebrity/Malinda%20Williams%20and%20D-Nice.jpg width=397 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Caption: Malinda Williams poses for a picture with her second husband, D-Nice.</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Photo Credit: suitestl.wordpress.com</p><p>The DJ was the one to confirm the split through a statement that said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I ask that our privacy be honored during this extremely personal time. I thank my family and fans for their endless support."</p><p>Moreover, Malinda's rep&nbsp;BJ Coleman said,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>"I never comment on my clients' personal lives,"</p><p>"I do know Malinda's main focus is always the well-being of her son. She is working on a couple of new projects and is excited about moving forward in 2010."&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Malinda Dating Or Seeing Anyone Lately?&nbsp;</h2><p>After failing to take both her marital relationships till the end of her life, is she dating anyone right now? This is the question that is on everyone's mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, thus far, there are no reports of her having a partner in her life right now as she is entirely focused on her career and giving her son the proper upbringing. Maybe that has kept her occupied, and thus, she has not presented a partner in her life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Maybe, she just wants no more heartaches, and maybe she has someone in her life who she is hiding out of the limelight.</p><p>Until further words from Malinda, let's wait and watch what comes up in this actress' life!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Malinda's Famous Hairstyle:</h2><p>Malinda is always known to have a very <a href=# rel=follow>stylish hair style.</a>&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She and her mother, Beverly Williams once shared <a href=# rel=follow>very useful hair tips</a> which they learned from one another.</p><p>Malinda <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>“I learned from my mom how to be fabulous at every age!! My mom always changed her hair while remaining fresh, fabulous and always age appropriate.”&nbsp;</p><p>She added, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-638 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“Always consider your face shape, lifestyle and texture. You'll get the most mileage out of styles and textures that enhance and showcase your natural assets. Stick with what works for you, not what is the trend of the moment. Everything isn't for everybody.”</p><p>Her mother Beverly then continued,</p><p>“A stressed mind can give you stressed hair.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Healthy hair, just like a pretty face, comes from within.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Caption:&nbsp;Malinda Williams' Mane Taming:&nbsp;A Short Hair Makeover.
