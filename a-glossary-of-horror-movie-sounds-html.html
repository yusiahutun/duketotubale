They serve up the understated chill of a woman walking alone at night — the slight click-clack of her heels against pavement raising hairs on the back of your neck — and volley back with a silence-shattering bus rushing into frame. Even the faintest of actions, like a knife slicing through air in a Scream installment, can produce eardrum-piercing shrieks when you least expect it. Flesh emits a powerful constellation of gooey noises in a Hostel movie, and leather tightening is positively stentorian. Watch enough scary movies, and you start to recognize the acoustic pattern.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qh1gw9000t3b6w4r0ws1w2@published data-word-count=191>We have an unseen horde of sound mixers, designers, and Foley artists to thank for much of this audio magic. Whereas legendary composers like John Carpenter and newcomers like Disasterpiece are credited with making horror feel cinematic, Foley work and sound design is what makes it feel real — even when it’s not. Artists take footage shot in production (and created by visual-effects artists in post-production) and reproduce or imagine its sounds — the swish of a curtain, the chatter of teeth — using props and digital effects to amplified results. Their humble tools break gore down into its component parts and give space for every rip and pop to offend; open a Foley artist’s fridge and you might find raw chickens meant to mimic sliced-up human flesh, or a whole pig’s head destined to get beat to hell to simulate the sound of a skull breaking. Elsewhere in their office is an old chamois responsible for a shocking array of gushy sounds. Next time you visit, think about bringing fresh celery or a box of rigatoni as a gift, in case the artist needs to snap some femurs that day.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qh1h20000u3b6w86yhhivd@published data-word-count=125>In celebration of all that head-splitting effort, Vulture has spent the spooky season poring over the sounds of scary movies, culled from our own memories as well as <a href=#>various conversations </a>with <a href=#>sound designers and Foley artists</a>. (And by sounds, we mean anything but scripted conversation and score.) Consider this a brief aural history of horror, or a taxonomy of some of the greatest Foley art and sound design from Cat People to the new Hellraiser and how each came to be. If anything, it’s a tribute to the technicians who walk over glass in stilettos, wrestle themselves in loose clothes, and fight a slab of beef to make us feel like we’re right there in the room with the Big Bad and the Final Girl.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9qh7q82001j3b6wpxftkg62@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Body Trauma</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qh8d6400213b6wrgxxrxne@published data-word-count=23>These are the throw-up sounds.

People are big gooey sacks of meat, after all. Which it why Foley artists take to pounding the hell out of pig heads and sides of beef with wooden mallets to get that slam of a body part just right. There are vegetarian options, too. Sound pro Wayne Bell, who worked on the original Texas Chainsaw, says the the thuds you hear when Leather’s mallet whams down on human heads are the result of hitting melons and cabbages.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9qi10kk006k3b6w4va01jef@published>The Vivisection</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qi1yzd006t3b6wskwm8o8b@published data-word-count=31><strong>Examples: the </strong><a href=#><strong>face slice</strong></a><strong> in Evil Dead (2013), the scalp rip in Hostel Part II, the full body bisection in Bone Tomahawk, the spilling of intestines in the opening of Scream.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qi4fqy007k3b6wla68hqip@published data-word-count=50>Vivisection is all about getting someone’s insides on the outside.

He recorded in and out of the mask for a variety of effects.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9qkfmhg00jb3b6wm2bog338@published>The Death Croak</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qkfsld00jj3b6w1vre6krv@published data-word-count=29><strong>Examples: Danny Torrance’s “friend” Tony in The Shining, the raspy scream of the Babadook in The Babadook, the hissing growl of Angela in Sleepaway Camp, Kayako’s warning in Ju-On.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qkfubb00jr3b6w6iqwgou7@published data-word-count=88>What is so awful about that throaty croak some demons and ghosts and little kids let loose? Is it the sound of the devil himself? The call of some prehistoric predator we are genetically determined to fear? It’s an indescribable death rattle, the croak that lets you know hell is near. Writer and director Takashi Shimizu first started making the sound now synonymous with the ghost of Kayako Saeki when he was a kid. Shimizu’s parents hated it, but the actual human guttural moan made cinematic history anyway.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9qm8w2h00873b72doya6a21@published>The Kaiju Bellow</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qm8q2j007z3b72zkp8s6nv@published data-word-count=9><strong>Example: the Godzilla shrieks in Godzilla (1954 and 2014).</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qmax9a008o3b72kr5vbkqw@published data-word-count=199>If any creature deserves its own category, it’s the kaiju. In the original Godzilla from 1954, the sound team tried to make his signature roar using actual animal noises, but composer Akira Ifukube is the one who cracked the case by using a leather glove coated in pine-tar resin that was then rubbed against the string of a double bass to create that sound from the friction. Jump ahead 60 years and the sound pros on 2014 Godzilla took a more composite approach. Sound designers Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn placed dry ice to sublimate on a metal vent, which produced vibrating and screaming noises as it evaporated. That was enhanced with the low-end sounds of rocks crunching. To get that finishing bellow, however, they dragged a giant wooden crate across a polished floor and deployed scientific microphones to capture sounds outside frequencies perceivable by the human ear before pitching them down in the studio. When they ended up playing the final product over gargantuan speakers on the Warner Bros. backlot — to record it with the effect of bouncing off real buildings and natural topography — the roar was heard from people about three miles away.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9qk3e3n00hd3b6wq2vew6p6@published>Predatorial Clicks</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qk3my200hm3b6w6e6s3msc@published data-word-count=28><strong>Examples: the Death Angel creatures in A Quiet Place, the chattering cenobite in Hellraisers, the aliens in Signs, Charlie Graham’s tongue click in Hereditary, the Yautja in Predator.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qk39f400h53b6wucm9m68x@published data-word-count=48>What do dinosaurs, Predators, and cenobites all have in common?

The shrieking victim will always be our avatar of fear, and the wailing villain will always signal his madness with a godless outcry.

There’s something especially insidious about weaponizing the ways we announce ourselves to each other — about turning a notification into a threat, whether that comes from an air raid siren or a ringtone or even a knock at the door.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9qlk18z00293b725g5z4i3q@published>“The Apocalypse Is Nigh!” Siren</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qlnid6002t3b72dec121um@published data-word-count=12><strong>Examples: the siren in Silent Hill, the commencement horn in The Purge.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qlq8r200313b72ehzcir9b@published data-word-count=76>There’s a category of scary sound that can’t be described any more effectively than … the noises you hear at the end of the world. Already alarming klaxons used to warn citizens about impending tsunamis or attack planes become even more harrowing when they signal the coming of creatures straight out of the abyss. Often hitting your ears with a combination of natural and mechanical noises, apocalypse sounds are meant to knock you on your ass.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qluwgp004g3b72o7vr2c05@published data-word-count=96>Purge creator James DeMonaco <a href=#>told his sound team</a> to model the now-infamous Purge commencement siren on the influential Tripod call from Steven Spielberg’s 2005 War of the Worlds. The foundation for that mech call is actually organic, coming from the buzzing boom of a didgeridoo wood instrument —&nbsp;before all manner of sound-designing wizardry was applied to make it alien. (Sound designer Michael Babcock created the factory like sounds of the Tripods moving by combining manipulated pneumatics, noises from roller coasters and moving gears, and the groans emitted by evaporating dry ice, all sequenced in 3/4 time.)</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9qlto0c003l3b72s9t87t7o@published>Knocks, Knocks, Knocks</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qm04i7004q3b72gc7pm82l@published data-word-count=28><strong>Examples: the single, terrifying knock on the door from The Strangers, the house attacks in The Haunting (1963 and 1999), all the pounding in Knock at the Cabin.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qlubgb003z3b72d8z66cpu@published data-word-count=155>One of the greatest tricks of horror cinema is taking the thing meant to keep us safe —&nbsp;the walls of our own homes —&nbsp;and turning them into the tools for our destruction. In Robert Wise’s<a href=#> original Haunting</a>, the occupants of Hill House are sieged by ghostly forces pounding on every wall and even the ceiling. Walls made of laminated wood flex as crew members behind them push against them on the other side, acting as angry spirits off camera. The relentless thrashing is so resonant yet sharp it sounds like metal pounding on wood, or like someone is shaking a sheet of thin metal. For the 1999 remake, sound designer Gary Rystrom created the movie’s various booms and crashes at houses scheduled for demolition. Rystrom and others went in and beat the hell out of walls and doors with baseball bats before layering those noises with the stock sounds of distant explosions and artillery detonations.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9qlu8vo003s3b72j4f3yak6@published>Phones From Hell</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qmdr2a009r3b72rlj8ggu0@published data-word-count=32><strong>Examples: The living room phone in When A Stranger Calls (1979), the sorority house phone in Black Christmas (1974 and 2006), Casey’s call in Scream, the mobile chime in One Missed Call.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qmfwui009z3b724nvsf91h@published data-word-count=75>First horror movies ruined doors by making every creaky hinge an ultimatum, and in time they would come for our phones, allowing them to puncture silence at a harsh frequency.

For Freddy’s blades in Elm Street, Foley artist Gary Hecker created razor-sharp sounds using two types of blades to create two different sound profiles. A machete produced the ringing blade sound, while surgical steel blades imparted a sharper pitch.

Director Bobcat Goldthwait stages a 22-minute scene that takes place entirely in a tent with the camera fixed in one position, creating an unbearably tense progression that lives entirely on the faces of the two protagonists as they react to sounds of the forest steadily closing in on them. Branches snap, wood knocks against wood, feet walk around outside crushing brittle leaves under them, mysterious moans drift in from the distance.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9qmsjff00b83b72mfjghxl8@published>Lewton Buses</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qmsqxa00bf3b72x0n0f9pi@published data-word-count=24><strong>Example: the bus in Cat People, Church the cat appearing out of nowhere in Pet Sematary (1989), seemingly </strong><a href=#><strong>any cat</strong></a><strong> in any horror movie.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qmtlnr00bs3b72yvn1v338@published data-word-count=104>In terms of jump scares in horror movies, the original Cat People really was that bitch. It gave us the iconic scene of Alice being pursued in the dark, which lead right into a startle so perfect that it gave a name to a whole category of frights that would come after. A Lewton Bus is whenever you have an interjecting fake-out scare. A thing —&nbsp;big or loud or jarring or all of the above —&nbsp;that prematurely pops the bubble of a silence stretched to its absolute limit of tension. It’s the valve release, but it’s not the main event.

A person’s gait and footfalls can be as specific as their voice, though, thus nailing a walk in a recording session is a performance on its own. The sound of quickening steps across the asphalt isn’t something that has to be invented by Foley artists to be scary, they just have to be painstakingly recreated. To do so, Foley artist Shaun Brennan says he <a href=#>keeps a suitcase full of shoes</a>, nestled next to his wigs, a switchblade, and handcuffs.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9qn64pc00cc3b72tx8q4qh6@published>Sudden Running</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qnpol100dl3b72bk9eslbd@published data-word-count=19><strong>Examples: the nighttime bedroom invasion in Paranormal Activity, the dead sprint in Annabelle, the night jog in Get Out.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qn6bwj00cj3b72lwqml6tk@published data-word-count=132>While the stalker’s steps slowly build up tension, the spontaneous sprint is like an adrenaline shot to the heart, with the speed of the footfalls mimicking your pulse as it spikes. When Annabelle Wallis sees the ghost of a little girl staring at her from the hall outside her room, you think that’s going to be the end of it. The door will swing shut and the girl will vanish, leaving everyone to wonder if it was a hallucination. But then out of nowhere, the little girl tears directly at Walls with no other sound or accompanying score —&nbsp;just the hollow, crescendoing sound of her feet thudding towards our heroine and us. Annabelle lifted the idea from Mario Bava’s Shock, and it worked so well that <a href=#>The Prodigy</a> did it after Annabelle.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9qo5ft600g03b72nka62p9l@published>White Noise</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qo66tf00g63b721fse2vhg@published data-word-count=28><strong>Examples: the voices in the white noise in White Noise, the wobbly high-pitched ring of the haunted VHS tape in Ringu and The Ring, the TV in Poltergeist.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9qo7rs900gc3b721ld3eocv@published data-word-count=92>White noise is the combination of multiple frequencies across the spectrum of audible sound, each with the same level of intensity. This results in its constant, stable sound. In a less technical sense, white noise is also where evil lives! When Carol Anne sat herself directly in front of the TV in Poltergeist with only a snowy screen of white noise emanating from the box, moviegoers were unhinged. In the age of streaming devices, it’s harder to encounter white noise in the wild, which hopefully means we have closed up the hellmouth.</p><h2>More From This Series</h2><ul class=package-list-items><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl9r9ivxf0000wx9gjt0wn5wc@published data-track-headline="Fear the Chamois" data-track-index=0 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>Fear the Chamois</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl9r6nf9u0000tlbrwjygyawr@published data-track-headline="John Carpenter Has Only One Criteria for a Film Score" data-track-index=1 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>John Carpenter Has Only One Criteria for a Film Score</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck0e5ywql00a0jsye3sw6jc37@published data-track-headline="The Hardest Horror Movie Sound I Ever Foley-ed" data-track-index=2 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>The Hardest Horror Movie Sound I Ever Foley-ed</span></a></li></ul><a class=see-all-link href=# aria-label="See All from More From This Series"><span class=see-all-link-text>See All</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The Sounds of Horror</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpa2dhZXyiecalpqyrkafGbrvFZp%2BoqqKkv265zq%2BgnmWjpMKvsNJnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fa-glossary-of-horror-movie-sounds-html.html&text=The%20Sounds%20of%20Horror&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-glossary-of-horror-movie-sounds-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-glossary-of-horror-movie-sounds-html.html&title=The%20Sounds%20of%20Horror" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fa-glossary-of-horror-movie-sounds-html.html&title=The%20Sounds%20of%20Horror" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fa-glossary-of-horror-movie-sounds-html.html&title=The%20Sounds%20of%20Horror" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-glossary-of-horror-movie-sounds-html.html&description=The%20Sounds%20of%20Horror" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./50-facts-about-the-movie-guess-whos-coming-to-dinner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="50 Facts about the movie Guess Who's Coming to Dinner">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./roan-curtis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Roan Curtis">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
