This time, we’re turning the spotlight on sustainable accessories label, ATP Atelier.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2010, Stockholm-based friends Jonas Clason and Maj-La Pizzelli decided to launch ATP Atelier (All Tomorrow's Parties). The pair were holidaying in Italy at the time when they discovered a small atelier in Otranto crafting elegant sandals, which inspired them to launch their own business, but with a point of difference. They wanted to create a city sandal, only ever finding casual beach alternatives, and they wanted to only use vegetable tanned leather. This mix of fine Italian craftsmanship with their Scandi minimalism and a commitment to sustainability has proven hugely successful for the label, which is now stocked in major retailers across the globe – and whose products are instantly recognisable to fashion editors everywhere.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As with many successful fashion brands, ATP had a very clear idea of what it wanted to be from the beginning, with the founders seeing a clear gap in the market for something they felt was important to fill.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Sustainability has been our why, our reason to be, since day one," co-founder and creative director Pizzelli tells me. "When founding ATP Atelier, I had no interest in putting yet another brand on the market just because. After working at Filippa K for so many years, initiating their work with sustainability, I realised there was no one focusing on high-quality leather goods from that same standpoint. Our mission then became to challenge the concept of luxury - to make it smart, not redundant."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair set out to craft high-end vegetable tanned leather accessories, using only the best and most sustainable materials they could find.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The first ATP Atelier shoe we ever made was in vegetable tanned vacchetta. Today the majority of our pieces (80 per cent) are made from that or another sustainable material – it's the backbone of every ATP Atelier collection. Leather products treated with natural vegetable tannins are biodegradable and can be easily discarded at the end of their natural life. The tanneries we employ also reclaim hides from the food industry to prevent waste. Vegetable-tanned leather does not contain any toxic substance such as azo-dyes, nickel, PCP or chrome VI."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unlike many fashion brands, who are now seeing what changes need to be made to their business models, this focus on the planet has always been at the core of what ATP Atelier does: "A sustainable mindset is the foundation on which our whole brand is built upon. For us it's not a trend, it's a given."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This commitment is not just seen in the materials that ATP chooses to use, but also in the way they design. In an effort to never encourage passing trends, the brand brings the same styles back time and time again and also instructs their customers on how to make the products last as long as possible.</p><img alt="ATP Atelier" title="ATP Atelier" width=4167 height=6250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/atp-atelier-4-1570788148.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The most sustainable pieces are those that last longer than one season, both physically, but also from a design point of view," Pizzelli explains. "We work with many of the same designs and shapes, updating them slightly from season to season. We never follow short-term trends, we want our pieces to feel relevant for many years to come. We also continually educate our customers (both retailers and end-customers) on how to care for their shoes and bags. We want them to show their ATP Atelier items a lot of love, so they can age beautifully, just like their owners."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, a commitment to sustainability is not solely responsible for the label's success, but the quality and craftsmanship of their pieces was key, as well as their ability to identify something else that they felt was missing from the market: the city sandal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"At that time everything was beachy. As a Scandi woman, there were really no styles available that would work in the south of Italy as well as in the streets of Stockholm and we really managed to fill a gap from that perspective. One of our absolute first sandals – Rosa, is still today one of our best-sellers. She works just as well in LA as in Tokyo and she will never go out of style."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This versatile approach is clear to see when you look at the brand's fanbase and how they wear the designs. From influencers teaming their sandals with tailoring to fashion editors taking them to the beach, ATP's products certainly appear able to relate to stylish women for all kinds of occasions.<br></p><img alt="ATP Atelier" title="ATP Atelier" width=4167 height=6250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/atp-atelier-5-1570790556.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And, of course, support from this area of the industry has also been powerful for getting ATP Atelier's name out there too.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The brand grew up in the social media age, we never had to adjust from analogue to digital. We have never worked with print ads or paid for exposure in any old media, everything has been digital, completely organic and personal. I definitely think that adds a kind of warmth to the brand which I love. It’s very 'us'."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Through this approach, the business has slowly grown and developed over its first decade, introducing a wider range of products, from boots to bags, but never venturing far from where it began.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"In some ways, our business has changed a lot, but in others, it has stayed exactly the same," Pizzelli says. "Our why, our materials and our aesthetic have not changed one bit, but of course we have developed, matured and grown. We’re not looking to change, but I think it’s important to always question the way you do things and evolve with the industry and the world in general, to not stagnate and become irrelevant."<br></p><img alt="ATP Atelier" title="ATP Atelier" width=4167 height=6250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/atp-atelier-1-1570788189.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And while the company is always trying to adapt to what is happening in our ever-changing world, the focus is the same and they will continue to stick to what they know best. Don't expect a ready-to-wear collection out of them anytime soon.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The idea since the beginning has been to be the best at one thing, and not be everything to everyone. We are experts at high-quality vegetable tanned leather and that’s what we want women to come to us for. Just like you go to the best bakery for your baguettes and the most beautiful flower store for your bouquet."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wGtwbWliZn10e8Ctp2aZpJq5qrHRZpibp6WpfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fatp-atelier-about.html&text=How%20ATP%20Atelier%20became%20the%20go-to%20for%20high-end%20leather%20accessories&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fatp-atelier-about.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fatp-atelier-about.html&title=How%20ATP%20Atelier%20became%20the%20go-to%20for%20high-end%20leather%20accessories" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fatp-atelier-about.html&title=How%20ATP%20Atelier%20became%20the%20go-to%20for%20high-end%20leather%20accessories" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fatp-atelier-about.html&title=How%20ATP%20Atelier%20became%20the%20go-to%20for%20high-end%20leather%20accessories" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fatp-atelier-about.html&description=How%20ATP%20Atelier%20became%20the%20go-to%20for%20high-end%20leather%20accessories" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fix-this-device-cannot-start-code-10.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Fix the &amp;quot;This Device Cannot Start (Code 10)&amp;quot; Error in Windows">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kim-min-hee.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Kim Min-hee dating?
