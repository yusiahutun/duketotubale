They met at his own home and hit it off. The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> are now married and share twins Ella and Alexander, six. But it wasn’t always a smooth path towards romance as George, 62, had to put up a chase. He says they started out as pen pals, and he thought she was just interested in being “buddies.”</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-531030322-1024x684.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-george-clooney-was-rejected-by-his-wife-amal>George Clooney was rejected by his wife Amal</h2><p>George Clooney has quite a long and plentiful dating history, but he had to ask his wife Amal out three times before she said yes to a date. The Ocean’s Eleven star has dated many high-profile women, including <a href=#>Hollywood</a>‘s Cameron Diaz and model Lisa Snowdon. However, he set his sights on Amal, 46, and was persistent.</p><p>A source told RadarOnline in 2014, the year the <a href=#>celebrity</a> married his wife, Amal had rejected him.</p><p>“She was engaging in the conversation after the introduction was made and then did the unthinkable. Amal walked away from the group George was with!” they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>“He was instantly more intrigued by her. George then inserted himself into another group Amal was talking with. She just wasn’t impressed by the Hollywood actor persona.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-he-asked-for-her-number-she-refused>When he asked for her number, ‘she refused’</h2><p>They continued: “George asked for her phone number at the end of the night, and she refused to give it to him! Again, another first.”</p><p>They added, she “made it clear” she wouldn’t give up her career or the life she had built for herself if they got together.</p><p>The insider claimed: “In the past, the ladies he has dated have requested George’s help in getting acting roles, securing hosting gigs, getting new agents.</p><p>“Amal has made it clear she intends to not give up her career. She will be based in London and Los Angeles. George has never been with a woman like her, and this is going to go the distance.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-george-s-agent-said-he-would-marry-amal>George’s agent said he would ‘marry’ Amal</h2><p>In 2018, George Clooney <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> David Letterman about meeting his wife Amal and how his attraction to her grew. He explained to the <a href=#>TV</a> show host he and his wife started out writing emails to each other after she went to his house. The meeting had been set up by a mutual friend and his agent had good instincts as they told the <a href=#>movie</a> star they would end up tying the knot.</p><p>Not only that, but Amal met his parents at the same time she met George, talk about first impressions!</p><p>The Fantastic Mr Fox actor said: “I got a call from my agent who said, ‘I met this woman who is coming to your house, who you’re going to marry. It really worked out that way.”</p><p>“The funniest thing was my mom and dad were visiting so my parents were there. And we just talked, we stayed up all night talking. And I got her email address because she was going to send me some pictures of my parents. So we started writing. I didn’t know if she wanted to go out with me – I just thought we were buddies.”</p><p>He later <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> The Hollywood Reporter they had a “good first date” and she handled the paparazzi who showed up “like a champ,” before adding things between them had then “escalated pretty quickly.”</p><p>They spent the Christmas of 2013 together and then married in September 2014.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WCcLPEqKmgnV2YubC7zZ6wZq%2BRqHqpu8ulsLCnn5nAbrTEmqmtrJinvKN5wa6rZq%2BZm7Jurcyao2aspae7prCMoaCmZZSkxK9506Gpnp1dqbausdJo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgeorge-clooney-was-hollywoods-heartthrob-but-wife-amal-turned-him-down-three-times.html&text=George%20Clooney%20was%20Hollywood%27s%20%27heartthrob%27%20but%20wife%20Amal%20turned%20him%20down%20three%20times&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeorge-clooney-was-hollywoods-heartthrob-but-wife-amal-turned-him-down-three-times.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-clooney-was-hollywoods-heartthrob-but-wife-amal-turned-him-down-three-times.html&title=George%20Clooney%20was%20Hollywood%27s%20%27heartthrob%27%20but%20wife%20Amal%20turned%20him%20down%20three%20times" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgeorge-clooney-was-hollywoods-heartthrob-but-wife-amal-turned-him-down-three-times.html&title=George%20Clooney%20was%20Hollywood%27s%20%27heartthrob%27%20but%20wife%20Amal%20turned%20him%20down%20three%20times" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-clooney-was-hollywoods-heartthrob-but-wife-amal-turned-him-down-three-times.html&title=George%20Clooney%20was%20Hollywood%27s%20%27heartthrob%27%20but%20wife%20Amal%20turned%20him%20down%20three%20times" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeorge-clooney-was-hollywoods-heartthrob-but-wife-amal-turned-him-down-three-times.html&description=George%20Clooney%20was%20Hollywood%27s%20%27heartthrob%27%20but%20wife%20Amal%20turned%20him%20down%20three%20times" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./woman-weightlifting-bodybuilding-gym-sensation-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Woman who started weightlifting to make it easier to push her son's wheelchair becomes a bodybuildin">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pictured-cross-dressing-gunman-july-4-philly-bloodbath-left-five-dead-blm-supporter-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cross-dressing gunman behind July 4 Philly bloodbath that left five dead is BLM supporter">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
