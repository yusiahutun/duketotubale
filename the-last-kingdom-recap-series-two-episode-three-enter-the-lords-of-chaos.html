This was a thoroughly enjoyable episode in which a great deal of emotional ground was covered, and yet at times I wanted to shout slow down, let us have some quiet moments of character development. It doesn’t have to be crash, bang, wallop all the time – fun though that can be.</p><h2 id=you-think-you-are-better-than-these-men-you-should-let-go-of-your-pride-it-will-be-the-death-of-you><strong>“You think you are better than these men … you should let go of your pride –</strong><strong> it will be the death of you.”</strong></h2><figure id=924421d2-2cec-49d3-b26c-814de9d1c069 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Uhtred is rescued by Ragnar and Hild in the nick of time.</span> Photograph: BBC/Carnival/Boris Martin</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>Uhtred’s time as a galley slave was a suitably miserable experience, filled with starvation, brutality and suffering then culminating in the horrendous death of poor Hallig, who ended his life strapped to the prow of a ship, his mouth slowly filling with salt water as his erstwhile companions were ordered to row him to his doom. Uhtred himself almost lost his spirit if not his life – the scene where he tried to fight Sven was heartbreaking – but was rescued by Ragnar and Hild in the nick of time. There followed one of the best, and quietest, scenes of the episode in which an exhausted Uhtred, finding a brief moment of peace after a year of pain, traced an insect’s flight through the air and spoke to Hild of his suffering: “I am ashamed of what I have become.” She in turn gave him back his pride, though it is perhaps worth noting that that pride and its attendant temper is not always Uhtred’s best quality, as the violent death of Abbot Eadred demonstrated. In truth, the abbot’s death was inevitable from the moment he refused to back down over Gisela yet it further highlighted how little Uhtred plays the game. By acting first and in fury he put himself back in Alfred’s service – it would serve him well to remember that next time he chafes at not being his own man.</p><h2 id=are-you-his-brother-we-are-bound-i-would-say><strong>“Are you his brother?” “We are bound, I would say.”</strong></h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>Uhtred has always made friends as swiftly as enemies and this week we met a new addition to the gang in the shape of sardonic Irishman Finan (played by Scottish actor Mark Rowley doing a reasonably convincing accent), a man who is excellent at delivering quips in the face of provocation and who keeps his word about promising death to all those who have enslaved him. In an ideal world he, Hild and Uhtred would traverse the country delivering justice and trading quips. Sadly Hild’s devastated expression at the end of the episode suggested that such delights are destined to remain a dream.</p><h2 id=it-would-cost-a-great-deal-of-both-blood-and-silver-to-conquer-these-lands-and-even-more-to-hold-ground-alliances-must-be-forged-and-unions-made><strong>“It would cost a great deal of both blood and silver to conquer these lands and even more to hold ground … alliances must be forged and unions made.”</strong></h2><figure id=43f489c5-a076-4acf-abcc-a227681589d8 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Alfred continues to give a masterclass in political machinations centuries before Machiavelli dreamed up The Prince.</span> Photograph: Joss Barratt/BBC/Carnival Films</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>My favourite scenes, however, were set in Wessex, where Alfred continued to give a masterclass in political machinations centuries before Machiavelli dreamed up The Prince. David Dawson is doing a sterling job here; his Alfred is surprisingly easy to root for, even when he’s bending everyone to his will. There’s an entertainingly dark strain of humour to both Bernard Cornwell’s books and this series and that is at its most clear during Alfred’s scenes: both meetings with the Ealdormen of Mercia were filled with pitch-black one-liners. I particularly loved the very one-sided negotiations with Aethelred (Reign’s Toby Regbo) for Aethelflaed’s hand (“A fair price I feel. Excellent”) although the death of Ceolwulf (David Gant having a glorious time chewing the scenery) was probably the night’s stand-out moment if only for Aethelwold’s unrestrained laughter. Oh Aethelwold, may you forever continue your crooked and endlessly amused path through life.<br></p><h2 id=additional-notes><strong>Additional notes</strong></h2><figure id=cdadcf88-a2ef-46e6-acaf-d5781c36168d data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Would the abbot really be so intemperate over Gisela?</span> Photograph: BBC/Carnival/Katalin Vermes</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> Guthred is proving to be as useless a leader as expected – though Abbot Eadred wasn’t much better.

In the opening episodes he seemed calmly conniving. His actions this week were a little too driven by villainy for villainy’s sake.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> It was nice to see more of Aelswith and Aethelflaed.
