Not so well. She directly told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://pagesix.com/2023/07/27/ethan-slaters-estranged-wife-lilly-jay-blasts-ariana-grande/>Page Six</a> that “[Ariana’s] the story really. Not a girl’s girl. My family is just collateral damage.” She also added that she’s focusing on raising her and Slater’s baby and being “a good mom.” Ethan officially filed for divorce on July 26, 2023, per <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/26/ariana-grande-boyfriend-ethan-slater-file-divorce-wife-lilly-jay/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ.</a></p><p>A source told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.etonline.com/ethan-slaters-estranged-wife-lilly-jay-devastated-amid-his-ariana-grande-romance-source-says-208505>Entertainment Tonight</a> that&nbsp;she’s “devastated” by the breakup. “This is not the future she had in mind,” the source said, “She’s doing her best to get back on her feet. She’s incredibly smart and driven” and “she is truly the best mother.”</p><p>Another source told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://pagesix.com/2023/07/21/ethan-slaters-wife-blindsided-by-ariana-grande-relationship/>Page Six</a> that Jay was “completely blindsided” by the relationship. “It’s horrible. They were high school sweethearts. They have a baby! She’s a wreck,”&nbsp;the source said.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/26/ariana-grande-boyfriend-ethan-slater-estranged-wife-abandoned-family/>TMZ</a> reported that sources close to Jay say that she feels completely abandoned by Slater and that he “turned his back on his family.” Another source told the gossip website. “It’s understandable that emotions are high and it’s hard seeing your ex move on, especially in such a public way, and her friends are trying to protect her. But Ari and Ethan are just trying to lay low and be respectful of their exes as they pursue this new relationship.”</p><p>Several sources told <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ethan-slater-told-wife-about-ariana-grande-days-before-the-news-broke/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Us Weekly </a>about their relationship status before he moved on to Grande. “Ethan sat Lilly down a few days before the news broke about him and Ariana and said that he wanted a divorce. Lilly never saw it coming!” said one source.</p><p>Another source assures that the married couple “were separated when they started dating and the relationship is recent.” They explained, “it’s understandable that its difficult to see an ex move on, especially in such a public way, and they are trying to be as respectful as possible,” the third source adds. Though Slater’s friends might be skeptical of the relationship, with sources adding that “[They’re] worried she’ll break his heart.”</p><p>On Mother’s Day, Slater made an Instagram post in tribute to his wife. “My best friend. 4 years married, 10 years together. And this is easily the best (and most *bizarre*) year yet.” Grande liked the post and Slater made his Instagram account private after news broke of their relationship.</p><p>According to some sources to People, Ariana’s filming schedule is partially to blame for her divorce with her now ex-husband Dalton Gomez. “She was happy in Los Angeles for a couple of years. She wanted to make a life there with Dalton,” the source said. “He is super focused on his career and needs to live in Los Angeles. It’s definitely been an issue for them. Dalton’s career is demanding and he can’t leave Los Angeles often. So when [Grande] started filming&nbsp;Wicked&nbsp;in England, they were in for a long-distance marriage.”</p><p>On July 17, 2023,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;reported that Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1616558/ariana-grande-dalton-gomez-divorce/ rel="noreferrer noopener">were divorcing</a> after she was seen without her wedding ring at Wimbledon. The two have been together since 2020. According to sources, the coupe just couldn’t make it work post-COVID and the level of Grande’s fame wasn’t something Gomez was at all prepared for. “When Covid restrictions lifted, we’re told their differences became alarmingly apparent. Dalton, an L.A. realtor, was taken aback by Ariana’s celebrity. He had not dealt with her schedule, the paparazzi and the various opportunities that took her out of L.A.,”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ reported</a>. “We’re told Dalton would sometimes question why they needed to go around town with security, something that was a must for Ariana. Their differences started to make the marriage unravel, and it was greatly exacerbated when she went to England last December to begin filming&nbsp;Wicked.”</p><p>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>ET&nbsp;</a>also confirmed the news of the breakup and that Gomez has been dating since their separation. “They’ve been quietly and lovingly working on their friendship,” the insider said. Another source said, “Ariana and Dalton’s friends have always been concerned by their whirlwind romance and felt their relationship would ultimately be short-lived.&nbsp;Their relationship has been rocky at different points, and they’ve had trouble making time for each other with scheduling issues.” Another source told<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://people.com/ariana-grande-ex-dalton-gomez-wanted-to-make-it-work-shed-moved-on-source-exclusive-7564102 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> People,</a> “Dalton is very religious and was committed to making it work, but Ariana had moved on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1550737351.jpg><p>Grande first started dating Gomez, a real estate agent who represents <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1227584/ariana-grande-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrity homes</a>, in January 2020. The “Thank U Next” singer confirmed their relationship in May in her music video for “Stuck with U” with Justin Bieber. The video saw Grande and Gomez slow-dancing. The confirmation came after speculation the two were dating from Grande’s Instagram posts, which showed her and Gomez quarantined together amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020, Grande confirmed that she and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Gomez are engaged</a>&nbsp;via an Instagram slideshow of photos of them together. Among the pictures was a shot of her engagement ring, which featured an oval-shaped diamond and a pearl given to her by her late grandfather. “forever n then some,” she captioned the post. The two got<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>&nbsp;secretly married</a>&nbsp;in 2021.</p><p>As for another wife who reacted to the news, SpongeBob Squarepants’s original voice actor Tom Kenny’s wife had to clarify that her husband was not dating Ariana Grande. “Hi everyone, I’m married to Tom Kenny (who voices SpongeBob on the TV show),” Jill Talley wrote on Instagram and coincidentally was their 27th anniversary, per <a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>.&nbsp;“He is not dating Ariana Grande. I don’t know if Ethan Slater (who played SpongeBob in the musical) is or isn’t dating Ariana Grande. However, they’re both adorable and I totally ship it. Just wanted to set the record straight.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
