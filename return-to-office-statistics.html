The new regulations grant workers the right to request flexible working, “but crucially, there's no guarantee that these requests will be granted,” she says. “This could leave thousands of employees who rely on flexible work in precarious positions if their requests are turned down. Individuals should know whether their needs can be accommodated before they accept a role.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The new legislation risks exacerbating “fake flexibility”, where companies claim to offer flexible working on job adverts, but are under no obligation to offer it in practice. This makes it nearly impossible for job seekers to determine which employers will genuinely accommodate their requests for flexible work.”</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The push for hybrid working</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Johnson-Jones' opinion of many employers being reluctant to allow flexible working in practice is reflected in the attitudes of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/major-businesses-demanding-workers-return-28918781 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="major businesses" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">major businesses</a>, such as Disney, Goldman Sachs and Tesla, which are asking employees to revert to a pre-pandemic, five-days-a-week office schedule. The move has not been popular – new data compiled by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.space32.com/marketplace?/?utm_source=PPC&utm_medium=Google&utm_campaign=Search_Brand_Space32&utm_keyword=space32_Exact&gclid=Cj0KCQjw5f2lBhCkARIsAHeTvlg-0opogkzPWc0I3lywpVbLyPenbqIAI3F5THZzov2Evs4gODVer0waAi_pEALw_wcB" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Space32 class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Space32</a>, a co-working company, has revealed that almost a quarter of Britons (23 per cent) would turn down their dream job if it required them to return to the office full-time.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Those who work from home are 47 per cent more productive<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is “a striking indication that those pushing for a full-time office return are fighting a losing battle,” says Jon Dweck, CEO and founder co-founder of Space32. “For younger generations in particular, who are at an earlier stage in their careers, going into the office full-time should not be a prerequisite for success. Employers must ditch this one-size-fits-all approach and acknowledge that employee attitudes have shifted.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A quick straw-poll of my friends supports Dweck’s findings. “I don’t think I could ever go back to working in an office full-time,” says Caroline, a 33-year-old marketing executive. “I think I’m more productive when I work from home a few days a week. It means I have a more balanced lifestyle, too, which means I take fewer days off due to sickness or holidays.” Milly, 38, a lawyer, agrees: “So many companies are offering really attractive hybrid working packages now. It would take an incredible opportunity to persuade me to go back to an office five days a week.”</p><img alt="career change bazaar at work" title="Career change - Bazaar at Work" width=667 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rc051917-12-077-preview-1594395802.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Regan Cameron for Harper's Bazaar</span><p>Research shows that 44 per cent of us would prefer a hybrid working model over any other</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The benefits of working from home – and the downsides</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Helen Cowan, founder of coaching company <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thetallwall.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Tall Wall" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Tall Wall</a>, the impact of the pandemic on working culture can’t be overstated. “It changed what we want from work, what the boundaries of work and home life can and should be, and the importance of finding our ‘purpose’ – what we’re working for, and what we want from life,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's important to consider the benefits and downsides of home-working. Yes, you may feel you have more focused, uninterrupted time to work on solo projects, greater scope to weave admin tasks into your day (putting on a load of laundry during your lunch break, for example) and more flexibility when it comes to responsibilities like childcare. However, working from home can pose a risk to career progression: joining an impromptu meeting at work or going out for a few drinks with your team on a Friday is often a great way to showcase your value, and receive informal mentoring. It’s why <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.apollotechnical.com/hybrid-working-statistics/#:~:text=Employees%20and%20employers%20who%20took,remote%20work%20as%20a%20possibility." data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a large number of people" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">a large number of people</a> – 44 per cent in the UK, in fact – favour a hybrid system which enables them to get the best of both worlds.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>A quarter of us would turn down our dream job if there was no opportunity for flexible working<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How to ask for flexible working</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If your company is resistant, how do you go about requesting a hybrid working pattern? The new regulations should make this easier, but companies may still be reticent to comply. “Barriers still exist: a LinkedIn study last year found that more than half (52 per cent) of women say a lack of flexibility at work has pushed them to leave, or consider leaving, a job,” says Olivia Bath, career coach and founder of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thewomensvault.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Women’s Vault" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Women’s Vault</a>. “Research what type of flexible arrangements are already in place in your organisation, and remember that negotiating flexibility is effectively negotiating the terms of your contract.”</p><img alt="gender pay gap career bazaar at work" title="Gender pay gap - career - Bazaar at Work" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gender-pay-gap-1522916232.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Regan Cameron for Harper's Bazaar</span><p>Cowan and Bath agree companies that don’t offer flexible working are likely to miss out on good candidates</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cowan agrees that you need to go into any negotiation well-prepared and ready to answer any tricky questions about performance and contact hours. “Think commercially and pragmatically from your employer’s point of view,” she advises. “An effective strategy is to propose a trial approach for three months and offer a check-in every month, to see how the set-up is working for all concerned. Few managers can deny a trial that is measured, monitored and has a potential get-out clause at the end.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Many companies may want their workforce to return to the office – but when hybrid working has been proved to be effective, employees have a powerful say. “This new data demonstrates that flexible working is a fundamental requirement these days, not a nice add-on,” says Cowan. “If flexible working isn’t part of the package, the job is simply not a dream job for many people. That’s a fundamental shift that is here to stay.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwvMSop6WdXaWus8DInqpompGvrqK%2BjJqrZq%2Bfp7hwrZNtbWxuZGmBcL7Erayrpl2pvG67xZ%2BgnJ1dqMGiwMisq6Kbo2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2freturn-to-office-statistics.html&text=New%20laws%20will%20give%20employees%20more%20right%20to%20flexible%20working&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2freturn-to-office-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2freturn-to-office-statistics.html&title=New%20laws%20will%20give%20employees%20more%20right%20to%20flexible%20working" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2freturn-to-office-statistics.html&title=New%20laws%20will%20give%20employees%20more%20right%20to%20flexible%20working" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2freturn-to-office-statistics.html&title=New%20laws%20will%20give%20employees%20more%20right%20to%20flexible%20working" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2freturn-to-office-statistics.html&description=New%20laws%20will%20give%20employees%20more%20right%20to%20flexible%20working" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ways-to-talk-to-people-grieving-cariad-lloyd-griefcast.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="You will get it wrong  but you cant make it worse: 16 ways to talk to people who are gri">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tom-austin-bio-net-worth-wife-age-and1-co-founder.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet AND1 Co-Founder Tom Austin!
