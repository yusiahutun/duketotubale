The 51-year-old admitted it led to secret behavior that he couldn’t hide from his family anymore. The comedy star has lost 112 pounds (eight stone) after worrying that he wouldn’t be alive to see his children grow up. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> confessed his struggle began after he managed to quit smoking and drinking. However, his bad habits were then replaced with a new vice.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nick-frost-s-weight-loss-journey>Nick Frost’s weight loss journey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-173221665-681x1024.jpg><p>Speaking with The Sunday Times magazine, Nick Frost’s biggest driver for his weight loss was to be around for his family.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>: “I have a two-year-old, you know, and I’m just aware that big fat men in their fifties don’t become big fat men in their sixties, and that’s just a fact.”</p><p>Nick admitted he would “hide” in his car to eat baked goods and chocolate bars. At the time, it became clear that he was battling an eating disorder.</p><p>Now, he’s taken responsibility for his <a href=#>health</a>. He proudly explained that he’s lost 112 pounds, so his “kids have the best dad they can have”. He recently shared a new photo of himself after losing the weight on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actor shares a daughter and son with his partner. Their private life is just that, out of the public eye. Nick’s partner hasn’t been photographed, and they keep their children’s names out of the spotlight.</p><p>He also shares Mac, his 12-year-old son, with his ex-wife Christina.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nick-frost-s-weight-loss-was-on-his-mind-years-before>Nick Frost’s weight loss was on his mind years before</h2><p>But it wasn’t the first time the <a href=#>movie</a> star has opened up. During the pandemic, the writer opened up that he was afraid of contracting covid and wanted to lose weight.</p><p>It also came at a time he lost a dear friend, Miles Ketley, who died suddenly aged 52.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> The Independent he “cried for like two hours” after shaving off his beard, and seeing himself.</p><p>“I shaved my beard off the other day, thinking I’d be some chiseled Judge Dredd-style guy underneath, but instead I cried for like two hours.</p><p>“I’m afraid of getting Covid, of the misinformation around it,” Nick admitted at the time. “I don’t know what the truth is. I don’t understand the tier system. Then Miles passing was just like, ‘F***!’ He was my brother. I know nothing about being a producer, but everything I know I learned from him. He was creative and fantastic at making deals. It was completely unexpected.”</p><p>It also wasn’t the first tragedy he faced. Nick sadly lost both of his parents and four of his half-siblings between 2005 and 2015.</p><p>“My professional success (relatively speaking) comes at a price,” he wrote in his memoir, Truths, Half-Truths and & Little White Lies.</p><p>“I want to tell you that things got better for me emotionally, but I can’t, they didn’t. Seemingly every time I did a film, another member of my family died. Was this the price I had to pay for success?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rise-to-fame>Rise to fame</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-455897912-707x1024.jpg><p>Nick Frost and his best friend Simon Pegg met years before stardom, when Nick was a waiter in a London restaurant. They hit it off and later lived together as roommates. Pegg, who wrote the cult <a href=#>TV</a> comedy series Spaced with Jessica Hynes, made a role for his pal Frost in the show.</p><p>Then, the pair sat down together to write Shaun of the Dead (2004), which would become another cult classic. It looked at the zombie genre in an entirely different light, receiving a loyal following from fans.</p><p>It became part of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, which also featured Hot Fuzz (2007) and The World’s End (2013). Each flick had a different flavor of the ice cream. The name, as niche as it is, stems from a silly joke from promoting the second film in the franchise. It just stuck.</p><p>The duo also starred in Paul alongside Hollywood star Seth Rogan. It follows an alien who crash-landed on Earth decades ago and had been working in Area 51 before breaking out in an attempt to get back home.</p><p>The pair have ventured off to work outside the partnership, with Pegg in the Mission Impossible and Star Trek series. Frost starred in The Boat The Rocked, Attack The Block, Snow White and The Huntsman movies, as well as Cuban Fury.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know needs support, there are many eating disorder helplines in the UK here to help.
