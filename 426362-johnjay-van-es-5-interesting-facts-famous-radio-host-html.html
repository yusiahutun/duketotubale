Here are 5 interesting facts that make Johnjay Vane Es the famed radio host he is today.</p><h3>1. His astrological sign is Virgo</h3><p class=align-left>Johnjay Van Es was born on 4 September. This makes his birth sign Virgo. He joins other <a href=#>celebrity</a> Virgo radio hosts such as Ellen K, Jessica Pereira, Michael Strollo, Tavis Smiley, Lazlow Jones, Dave Ramsey, and Paris Nicole.</p><h3>2. Johnjay started in sales before becoming a host</h3><p class=align-left>You may think or imagine that Johnjay immediately got into radio, and that's why he is so famous. Well, that is not the case. Even though it was his dream to host on a radio station, Johnjay Van Es began his career as a sales intern for several <a href=#>radio stations</a> in San Diego.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1e6dd275c55bf3df.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bob Barker from The Price Is Right: net worth, wife, children, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>His first job was interning in promotions, then later got a paying job with promotions. Johnjay realized, later on, people working in sales drove fancy cars then decided to give it a try. So he got into sales and did it for some time before joining radio.</p><p class=align-left>Johnjay Van Es knew deep down that sales were not what he wanted to do. He wanted to own a radio show or perform on <i>Saturday Night Live.</i> So with the support of his then-girlfriend Blake, Van Es went to Los Angeles to audition for The Groundlings and got the chance to do it for a couple of years.</p><p class=align-left>A few years later, he came across his friend who hired him for his first promotion job. The friend reached out to Johnjay Van Es and offered him another position for hosting a morning show in Cincinnati. Johnjay was ready and immediately flew out for the job. He was hired after hosting the show for four days, and that’s how he got into radio. Johnjay got his first radio job in Cincinnati in 1996.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f8587861fa0df801.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Chef G. Garvin bio: wife, children, net worth, cooking channel</span></p></a><h3>3. Van Es is married and has three children</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b786df4451649b89.jpg><p class=align-left>As much as Johnjay Van Es is a private person, he never shies away from talking about his <a href=#>family</a> or posting them on social media. Johnjay has a beautiful wife and three boys who he calls his family. Johnjay Van Es’ wife is named Blake, and their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">three sons</a> are Dutch, Jake, and Kemp.</p><p class=align-left>Blake was born and raised in Arizona. The two met at work in their respective radio stations. They worked for one <a href=#>company </a>with the same owner, general manager, and building, but different radio stations. Blake was doing radio sales just like Johnjay Van Es when they met.</p><p class=align-left>They dated for quite some time and eventually married when Johnjay worked at The Groundlings in Los Angeles. The couple shifted to different states with the changes that came with Johnjay's radio job.</p><p class=align-left>Blake and Johnjay once stayed in Houston for three years, and the state wasn’t so nice to them. They dealt with a lot, and Johnjay termed it “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">three worst years of my life</a>” and “a nightmare time.” The couple struggled through a pregnancy that eventually resulted in them losing their twin girls.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a134e33615cbe6f7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dolvett Quince biography: wife, children, family, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Luckily, that was not the end of the road for them. The couple moved to Arizona when Johnjay Van Es got a job in Tucson. Blake and Johnjay are blessed with three sons who are eight years, seven years, and four years old.</p><p class=align-left>There were speculations that Johnjay had a mistress and was caught up in a scandal. But unfortunately, there isn’t much information to back up Johnjay Van Es' cheating scandal. The chef has also not come out to clear the air.</p><h3>4. Johnjay Van Es is big on charity</h3><p class=align-left>It is worth noting that Johnjay is a selfless person committed to helping the helpless, be it a fellow human being or animal. The famous American <a href=#>radio host</a> runs two foundations in which one helps children in foster care while the other rescues dogs.</p><p class=align-left>LoveUp Foundation deals with spreading love and kindness while supporting the foster care system of Arizona. Johnjay Van Es also rescues dogs through his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LovePup Foundation</a> that was founded in 2015. He opened Instagram accounts for the sister foundations, linked to Johnjay Van Es' Instagram page.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1f67edeb3be93207.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tom Vitale: net worth, Valerie Bertinelli relationship, career, family</span></p></a><p class=align-left>LovePup offers foster and volunteer care to abandoned dogs. It also always adoption of the dogs by families that want to have a pet dog and ready to care for them. Zedd assisted in marketing Johnjay’s dog adoption project.</p><p class=align-left>What’s interesting about LovePup is the idea came from a listener of Johnjay and Rich’s morning show. The listener called in about a stray Chihuahua. The dog was posted on Johnjay van Es Instagram page, and Johnjay got numerous requests for adoption.</p><p class=align-left>A couple adopted the Chihuahua, which gave the famous radio host the idea of connecting stray dogs with families that would want to adopt them. And that’s how the LovePup foundation came to life. Interesting, isn’t it?</p><h3>5. He is one of the richest radio hosts born in California</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1e6dd275c55bf3df.jpg><p class=align-left>Johnjay Van Es knew he would be a radio host in one way or another, but rich and famous?
