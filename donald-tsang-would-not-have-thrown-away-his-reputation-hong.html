If he had indeed made a declaration, which he was not obliged to make, Montgomery suggested, it might be worse as his subordinates might think it was an attempt by him to exert pressure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The charge Tsang was facing that holds a chief executive accountable for bribery was established under Tsang’s administration, she said. “So he could go to prison if he accepts an advantage,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mr Justice Andrew Chan Hing-wai told jurors to return on Tuesday, when he is expected to sum up the case before they are sent out to deliberate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The jury may need to stay overnight at the High Court if their deliberations take longer than a day, prompting Chan to remind the jury to bring their own underwear as their personal belongings would be a lot more comfortable than the underwear provided by the judiciary.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: ‘Tsang would not have thrown away reputation’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoo5qvXZi%2FqrnEaJirrJmYuaZ7kWltcnFgbnylu82ao51lpKiur7OMsKaupJRiu7DAjKGYr51dqbWzu9anZJqvka56qbXSZqmeqKWprrW1zqdkoaeenA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdonald-tsang-would-not-have-thrown-away-his-reputation-hong.html&text=Donald%20Tsang%20would%20not%20have%20thrown%20away%20his%20reputation%2c%20Hong%20Kong%20High%20Court%20told&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdonald-tsang-would-not-have-thrown-away-his-reputation-hong.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdonald-tsang-would-not-have-thrown-away-his-reputation-hong.html&title=Donald%20Tsang%20would%20not%20have%20thrown%20away%20his%20reputation%2c%20Hong%20Kong%20High%20Court%20told" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdonald-tsang-would-not-have-thrown-away-his-reputation-hong.html&title=Donald%20Tsang%20would%20not%20have%20thrown%20away%20his%20reputation%2c%20Hong%20Kong%20High%20Court%20told" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdonald-tsang-would-not-have-thrown-away-his-reputation-hong.html&title=Donald%20Tsang%20would%20not%20have%20thrown%20away%20his%20reputation%2c%20Hong%20Kong%20High%20Court%20told" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdonald-tsang-would-not-have-thrown-away-his-reputation-hong.html&description=Donald%20Tsang%20would%20not%20have%20thrown%20away%20his%20reputation%2c%20Hong%20Kong%20High%20Court%20told" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-manually-control-your-iphone-camera-and-why-youd-want-to.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Manually Control Your iPhone Camera (And Why You'd Want To)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chris-osgood-and-jenna-osgood.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Osgood and Jenna Osgood">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
