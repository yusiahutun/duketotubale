It first aired in the UK on in September, 2010 and then premiered in the U.S. on PBS, as part of its Masterpiece Classic anthology, in January, 2011. The show ran for six seasons and fifty-two episodes, including five Christmas specials. Millions of Americans were instantly hooked and tuned in every week to watch the Downton Abbey cast bring the glitz, glamour and charm of the early 20th century characters to life. So much so, that after the end of the series, two feature films were made, Downton Abbey (2019) and Downton Abbey: A New Era (2022). Here, we catch up with the beloved Downton Abbey cast, and discover what they’ve been doing away from the Crawley estate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The premise of Downton Abbey</h2><p>Downton Abbey follows the lives of Britain’s aristocratic Crawley family and the life downstairs among their servants. The show begins after the Titanic sinks, in April 1912.&nbsp;Fans quickly fell in love with the drama, the dry British humor, the banter and the chemistry between characters. The superb acting, character development and incredible costumes didn’t hurt.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/2-2.jpg><p>The show has a mix of humor and tragedy and series creator <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julian Fellow</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">es</a> (who recently also produced the hit show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gilded Age for HBO</a>, which has a similar premise but set in Manhattan around the same time period) integrated real-life, tragic world events with everyday living. Whether you’ve never seen the show or you’d love to return to the Downton Abbey world again and again, you can stream it on <a href=#>PBS Passport</a> and <a href=#>Amazon Prime</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Catch up with the Downton Abbey cast</h2><p>Here is what some key members of the all-star cast of Downton Abbey are doing today:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary Talbot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/1-4.jpg><p>The character of Lady Mary Talbot, oldest daughter of the Earl of Grantham, started off the series as a bitter and mean woman, but as time went on, a softer side emerged.</p><p>British actress <a href=#>Michelle Dockery</a> is married to Jasper Waller-Bridge (many Downton Abbey stars attended <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their September 2023 wedding</a>). Since the series has ended, Dockery reprised her role in the movies Downton Abbey (2019) and Downton Abbey: A New Era (2022), and a few TV series including Netflix’s Godless.</p><p>But a key role in her post-Abbey career is a crossover into the singing world. Dockery and Abbey co-star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael C. Fox </a>(who played Andrew Parker in the fifth and sixth season) have teamed up and formed the musical duo Michelle & Michael. They released an album <a href=#>The Watching Silence</a> in 2022.

She also did voiceovers for Sherlock Gnomes and the video game Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery. She also had parts in A Boy Called Christmas and The Miracle Club. After overcoming breast cancer, Smith is in good health today and is thriving at age 88 and recently <a href=#>became the spokesperson for Loewe luxury fashion line</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hugh Bonneville as Robert Crawley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Copy-of-side-by-side-1-2.jpg><p>In his role as <a href=#>Robert Crawley</a>, the Earl of Grantham, <a href=#>Hugh Bonneville</a> — a British actor known for live theater performances with Royal Shakespeare Company and other companies — shines.
