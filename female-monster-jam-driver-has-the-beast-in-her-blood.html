We can drive a monster truck; there are pretty incredible things women can do.”</p><p>Grave Digger – created by Dennis Anderson in 1982 (he lives in the aptly-named Kill Devil Hills, N.C. — is one of the most decorated Monster Jam&nbsp;trucks in the world. Dennis Anderson won four Monster Jam World Finals&nbsp;championships, capturing the racing title in 2004 and 2006, and the freestyle title in 2000 and 2010.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/04/GraveD.png><p>“Monster Jam is all I know. I was born into the sport through my dad,” Krysten says in <a href=#>her online bio</a>. She has three brothers (all Monster Jam drivers) and said her favorite part about competing in Monster Jam is getting to carry on the family legacy.</p><p>“During the peak of his career was the early stage of my life, and one of the coolest things was my dad being the Grave Digger creator,” Krysten said Tuesday. She recalled bringing her 4th-grade class to her father’s shop and them being super impressed.</p><p>There are six Grave Digger trucks that tour with Monster Jam and she was the first female driver for it; there are about 50 drivers for them today, including her big brothers Adam and Ryan.</p><p>Krysten said her dad became a different person when he got behind the wheel of the huge truck (its tires alone are 66 inches tall and 43 inches wide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/04/Krysten6.png><p>“People loved my dad – he’s super down to earth, he’s the salt of the earth, so humble,” she said. “When he drove the truck, he became a madman. The crowd would go crazy; they’re going frickin’ insane. This guy doesn’t care if he breaks the truck. He’s there to entertain us. My dad was a major crowd-pleaser.”</p><p>Krysten was floored seeing the reactions her father inspired.</p><p>“It was crazy – so many people would get so emotional,” she recalled. “My dad was their hero. He’s hugging people, signing autographs.”</p><p><strong>Inspiring others</strong></p><p>As a pioneering female monster truck driver, Krysten also sees it as part of her job to inspire girls.</p><p>Last November, she posted on <a href=#>her Facebook page</a>: “In a world that wants women to whisper, I choose to yell. Take up space in this world girls.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/04/Krysten3.jpg><p>On her Monster Jam page, when asked about advice she’d give to kids, Krysten says: “No dream is too big. Don’t let anyone tell you, you can’t do something because of your gender, age, race, etc., because you can! Work hard, stay focused and follow your heart… it will take you far.”</p><p>“I wanted to be an inspiration for girls,” she said Tuesday. “It’s really heartwarming to see little girls come up after a show. I love them so much. They say, ‘You’re so brave’; that’s cool. I want them to have someone who looks like them.”</p><p>Krysten didn’t feel very brave in 2017, when she did her first back flip (by driving forward and then turning the truck upside down and back up) in Grave Digger, at a sold-out Las Vegas venue with 65,000 screaming fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/04/Krysten2-1.jpg><p>“It’s a 13,000-pound truck and you have to be right on the money with a back flip. There’s no room for error,” she said. “And it’s at the World Finals – it’s our Super Bowl, the World Cup. It’s my dad’s 35th anniversary (of Grave Digger), and he had been injured. We were feeling very emotional.”</p><p>“I had to time it perfectly,” Krysten recalled, noting she only had one practice run there before the actual show. “I’m like, ummm, I’ve been literally driving a monster truck for five minutes – I can do a back flip, whatever.”</p><p>She did it and the crowd went predictably crazy. “I was so proud of myself, I was tearing up in my cab…I’m so glad we landed it, and now I have one of the best back-flip averages of all the drivers.”</p><p><strong>Finding her own style</strong><strong></strong></p><p>Krysten credited her brothers for helping prepare her for Monster Jam.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/04/Krysten7.jpg><p>“Adam is more a wild card, super technical. He’s a really great racer,” she said. “Ryan is super, super controlled chaos. He’s insane – easily one of the top drivers in Monster Jam.”</p><p>“My style, a lot of people tell me I remind them of my dad,” she said. “I’m also a little unpredictable. I am very competitive – I like to do my best, very clean and consistent.</p><p>“I’m crazy too; I can keep up with the guys,” Krysten said. “I’m willing to push the limits to win.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/04/Cozad3.png><p>One of the other women among Monster Jam drivers is <a href=#>32-year-old Davenport native Myranda Cozad</a>, who was part of the April 2022 tour that came to the Moline arena.</p><p>“Myranda is a tough cookie,” Krysten said. “She has grown by leaps and bounds. She’s one of the toughest competitors, too. She’s a little wild card.”</p><p>The May 6 Monster Jam shows will be at 1 p.m. at Vibrant Arena, 1201 River Drive, Moline. Tickets are $24 to $69, available at the box office or <a href=#>online HERE</a>.</p><p>For more information, visit the <a href=#>Monster Jam website HERE.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJ2epZGhsm65zqeqrZ2iYreiuYydqaKulad6qa3SZquhnV2XsqK%2F02agp2WYmr9ursuopp1n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffemale-monster-jam-driver-has-the-beast-in-her-blood.html&text=Female%20Monster%20Jam%20driver%20has%20the%20beast%20in%20her%20blood&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffemale-monster-jam-driver-has-the-beast-in-her-blood.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffemale-monster-jam-driver-has-the-beast-in-her-blood.html&title=Female%20Monster%20Jam%20driver%20has%20the%20beast%20in%20her%20blood" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffemale-monster-jam-driver-has-the-beast-in-her-blood.html&title=Female%20Monster%20Jam%20driver%20has%20the%20beast%20in%20her%20blood" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffemale-monster-jam-driver-has-the-beast-in-her-blood.html&title=Female%20Monster%20Jam%20driver%20has%20the%20beast%20in%20her%20blood" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffemale-monster-jam-driver-has-the-beast-in-her-blood.html&description=Female%20Monster%20Jam%20driver%20has%20the%20beast%20in%20her%20blood" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-adjust-siris-volume-on-iphone-and-ipad.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Adjust Siris Volume on iPhone and iPad">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./633d4a9c22601d9d2a8b4577-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aaron Judge, el nuevo hroe americano de los dos chicles, acaba contrato">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
