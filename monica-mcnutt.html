They both are enjoying their life to the fullest and are probably planning to get married soon.</p><p>However, we couldn’t find a single piece of evidence that supports the same claim because it seems she likes to keep her romantic life away from the limelight. Monica likes to spend quality time with her friends whenever she has spare time because she shares tons of pics chilling with her friends on Instagram.</p><h3>Monica McNutt Salary/Net Worth</h3><p>McNutt has an impressive role within MSG Networks, where she not only hosts her own show but also co-hosts the late-night sports talk show known as MSG 150.
