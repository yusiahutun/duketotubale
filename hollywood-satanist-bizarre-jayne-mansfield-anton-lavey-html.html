Anton LaVey was a publicity-courting Satanist eager to attract new members to his fledgling Church of Satan. In 1966, they met for the first time in San Francisco. They found in each other a kindred spirit with a desire to be famous and a daring to be different. The pair developed a friendship – that some say was sexual in nature – and continued to meet frequently until Mansfield’s death in 1967.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They met at the height of the liberating 60s, when attitudes about gender, sexuality and nudity were in flux. Satanism – considered as the pursuit of a pleasurable and successful life – found a receptive audience in the thousands who flocked to California with a desire to become famous. A popular legend that might have been spread by LaVey himself asserts that he portrayed the devil who rapes Mia Farrow’s character in the 1968 film Rosemary’s Baby.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On hand to document the budding friendship between the blonde and the Satanist was German paparazzo Walter Fischer, who arrived in the United States in 1956 with a parrot on his shoulder and a desire to photograph larger-than-life American stars.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Little is known about Fischer. Many of his photographs were lost or only appeared in blurry newspaper archives. A Swedish collector named Alf Wahlgren began gradually acquiring Fischer’s photographic archive and connected with fellow Swede Carl Abrahamsson, a book publisher and ‘American trash culture’ aficionado.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And now, the pair is releasing a book of Fischer’s photographs called California Infernal: Anton LaVey and Jayne Mansfield as portrayed by Walter Fischer. The book is being released by <a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Trapart Books</a> and <a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>JD Holmes</a>.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The fascinating photographs show LaVey performing Satanic rituals in the Black House, his stark, ugly base in San Francisco’s Richmond District. These pictures are contrasted with Mansfield in her Pink Palace, her singular shrine to excess in Los Angeles. When the two joined together – at a restaurant in downtown LA, or at the Palace complete with a heart-shaped pool – paparazzi were always on hand to snap pictures of the outlandish spectacle on display.</p><img id=i-98a2310a9cb8515a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/18/17/427411ED00000578-4707902-image-a-7_1500395867502.jpg height=1215 width=962 alt="Jayne Mansfield (sitting at right) and Anton LaVey (kneeling at left) embarked on an intense relationship between 1966 and 1967.

She wanted to be a movie star, and a movie star in Hollywood.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘And she went all the way,’ said Abrahamsson, 51. ‘From the most crass point of view, I think there was a mutual admiration, almost a mutual insight: This is another weird person. We can sort of beneficially use each other for our own PR purposes.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mansfield and LaVey met for the first time while she was visiting the San Francisco Film Festival in 1966. Legend has it that she was kicked out of the festival after she arrived in a flashy pink dress sans underwear.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Differing accounts suggest that she had either requested a meeting with LaVey previously or, intrigued by reports she heard from fellow festival-goers, simply showed up at his Black House uninvited. Whatever the circumstances, she arrived at the nondescript Victorian house with her then-boyfriend, Sam Brody, during the festival.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Brody was serving as Mansfield’s divorce attorney through her third marriage. He was likely jealous of LaVey’s potential influence on Mansfield, who was attracted to more muscle-bound men such as Mickey Hargitay, a former Mister Universe and her second husband.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Even though he was almost exactly the opposite from what Jayne found physically appealing, she agreed to a relationship with Brody because she imagined it would ensure her custody of her four children. Almost immediately Jayne had second thoughts.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Brody showed a side of himself that was violently jealous, imposing impossible constraints on Jayne. She was in the process of trying to ease out of the situation, but Brody was becoming only more protective, using her pending custody suit to maneuver her deeper into a relationship,’ noted Blanche Barton, a former high priestess of the Church of Satan and the author of ‘The Secret Life of a Satanist.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Perhaps this jealousy led Brody to mock LaVey’s house of satanic obscurities at any chance he could. Barton writes that he picked up priceless objects and laughed at them and then lit a skull candle in LaVey’s ritual chamber. This egregious act was the last straw for LaVey.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>LaVey told him: ‘That candle is used only for curses. I don’t know what’s going to happen to you now. I only hope I’ve put it out in time.’</p><img id=i-b86e86d1868b6080 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/18/17/427411F500000578-4707902-image-a-6_1500395637492.jpg height=1353 width=962 alt="LaVey and Mansfield are pictured together, with LaVey holding her pet chihuahua.

She didn’t need emotional turmoil,’ Barton writes that LaVey told her. ‘For her own ego gratification, she knew she needed public admiration, men fawning after her. The more fawning Jayne received, the more she needed an antidote. But that takes incredible perspective to be able to remove yourself enough to recognize your own needs so clearly. Most people don’t have the courage to take such a realistic look at themselves. That’s why she enjoyed being with me, I suppose. I wasn’t afraid to give her what she wanted.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mansfield herself did not comment on the rumored affair. But she became, it is alleged, further entranced with Anton’s seeming powers after an incident with one of her sons.</p><img id=i-f4191b4b93f6eedd src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/18/17/4274121200000578-4707902-image-a-11_1500395929876.jpg height=697 width=962 alt="LaVey (left) and Mansfield (right) are pictured entering La Scala, a restaurant in Beverly Hills, California.

Once, Barton notes, Mansfield asked LaVey to send her an incubus – a male demon who visits women in their sleep.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And of course, there were their meetings. They dined at La Scala in Beverly Hills, with LaVey sporting his resplendent cape. They met for a photo shoot at her Pink Palace on Sunset Boulevard. And paparazzi were always on hand to document them as they held court. Fischer, the German photographer, quickly found himself in their good graces and secured intimate access to their publicity-courting lifestyle.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘[Fischer] was smart enough to realize this is how you do it: You do it the Slim Aarons way. You strike up acquaintances, you make friendships. Because then you’re welcomed back. You can always get, you know, the latest gossip, the latest juice, the latest news. And you can get to see people several times. And that’s exactly what he did with both LaVey and Mansfield,’ Abrahamsson noted.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fischer documented the bizarre appearance of LaVey – cape, horns and all – at Mansfield’s Pink Palace. The pair was photographed playing with her pets – an Ocelet and her two Chihuahuas – chatting by her heart-shaped pool and performing on a garishly taxidermy tiger skin rug. LaVey worked out in the Palace’s gym, formerly the haunt of Mickey Hargitay.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The paparazzo would send along press releases to accompany his shots. One quotes both LaVey and Mansfield.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>LaVey said: ‘She thinks it’s the greatest thing going. She is taking instructions. I made her a priestess and told her the concept of hell and paradise. I give her the usual information: working on ritual and how to cast (spells). She likes to know about witches and love charms. She considers me a High Priest.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Somewhat conflictingly, Mansfield said in the same release: ‘It is very interesting. I know the real basis of his church. I think he is a genius and I regard him as an interesting person. I am a Catholic and would not believe in his church. I am not a member of the black circle.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Such contradiction should not, Abrahamsson asserts, be seen as shoddy journalism.</p><img id=i-9bb5e0cf17e6f1c4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/18/17/427411C500000578-4707902-image-a-19_1500396363831.jpg height=955 width=962 alt="Mansfield corresponded with LaVey between October 1966 and June 1967, when she died suddenly in a car crash.

She was 34 years old.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was in a Buick car traveling from Biloxi, Mississippi to New Orleans along with Brody, driver Ronnie Harrison, and three of her children: Zoltan, Miklos and Mariska. Harrison crashed into the rear of a tractor-trailer. The children survived, but all three adults perished. A rumor spread that Mansfield was decapitated because a blonde head of hair appeared through the Buick’s windshield. In fact, it was only her wig.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Later, LaVey conducted a Satanic memorial service for her at his Black House in San Francisco.</p><img id=i-2344637957835565 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/18/17/427411CE00000578-4707902-image-m-15_1500396196361.jpg height=804 width=962 alt="Walter Fischer arrived in the United States with his 60-year-old parrot.

But, as Abrahamsson suggests, that is somewhat beside the point.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He wrote: ‘As the truth (if there is such a thing) about their complex and ever fascinating relationship will never be fully known, perhaps we should just be content with joyfully taking part of these larger-than-life space-time intersections and the individual legacies of these two true American icons?’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jayne Mansfield was born Vera Jayne Palmer in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in 1933. An intelligent student, she studied acting at university and entered and won quirkily named beauty contests including Gas Station Queen, Miss Lobster and Miss Fire Prevention Week. Her voluptuous hourglass figure cost her roles in the conservative climate of 1950s Hollywood but won her a nude shoot with Playboy in 1955.</p><img id=i-87861bf02152173e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/18/19/427609C300000578-4707902-image-m-35_1500401069023.jpg height=748 width=962 alt="Mansfield is pictured holding her newborn son, Zoltan.

While at a dinner with Sophia Loren in 1957, Mansfield was photographed having a nipple slip. Pictured is a different photograph of Loren and Mansfield from that same evening</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The following year, Mansfield signed with Twentieth Century Fox, whose executives hoped she could become the new Marilyn Monroe. She was named one of the most promising newcomers at the 1957 Golden Globe Awards for her performances in films such as The Girl Can’t Help It. But by the early 1960s, her career had fizzled out. Despite gaining some edge as one of the first major Hollywood actresses to appear nude in a film – Promises! Promises! in 1963 – Mansfield lost her star.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Even though she might have wanted to, I don’t think she would’ve, as you say, cut the mustard. She wasn’t really that talented. Her zest and her, you know, composite drive to be a star, because that’s basically what it was about for her; she wanted to be seen, she wanted to be famous in the proto-American way. And then she realized that it’s all about PR, you know, there’s no bad publicity,’ Abrahamsson said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But she might have been a victim of over-exposure. From 1955, she scandalized the public with a series of playful wardrobe malfunctions. Most infamous was her photograph with Sophia Loren at a 1957 dinner party. Mansfield’s dress was cut so low that a photographer snapped a picture showing her cleavage and one nipple.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Loren, in the photo, is pictured gazing downward at Mansfield’s nipple.

They, the fans feel that they kind of own you. And if you if you kept your life a complete secret, it wouldn’t be fair to them,’ she told English broadcaster Robert Robinson in a 1960 interview.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite her cultivated image as the stereotypical dumb blonde, Mansfield was by many accounts a highly intelligent woman who spoke five languages and had a lust for knowledge. And in multiple interviews, she appeared to be quite conscious that she was giving the public what it wanted.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Nobody cares about a figure like 163,’ she once said of her alleged IQ. Referring to her hourglass shape, she added: ‘They're more interested in 40-21-35.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Echoing this sentiment during a 1964 interview in France, she said: ‘Part of being a glamour girl is being, in a way, rather naive and helpless to the public, especially the eyes of men.’</p>&nbsp;I feel that a star owes it to her public to, to bring the public into her life. They, the fans feel that they kind of own you. And if you if you kept your life a complete secret, it wouldn’t be fair to them Jayne Mansfield<p class=mol-para-with-font>LaVey himself told Blanche Barton: ‘[Mansfield] never had any reinforcement for her intellect. When she was around me, she would often try to be “intellectual.” Recite Browning and use a drawn-out “ah” sound. She liked to say “om-u-let” when she meant amulet. She thought it sounded classier. She made it sound like some obscene breakfast dish. Unfortunately, intellectualism clashed with the image she presented. People would laugh.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mansfield was survived by her five children: Jayne (born 1950), Mickey (born 1958), Zoltan (born 1960), Mariska (born 1964) and Tony (born 1965).</p><img id=i-af972938c2a990a0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/18/22/4274120400000578-4707902-LaVey_is_pictured_paying_his_respects_to_Marilyn_Monroe_at_her_g-m-1_1500411808254.jpg height=632 width=470 alt="LaVey is pictured paying his respects to Marilyn Monroe at her grave in Westwood Village Memorial Park cemetery in Los Angeles.

Monroe died of a drug overdose in 1962</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Anton LaVey was born Howard Stanton LaVey in Chicago in 1930. His parents moved to the San Francisco Bay Area when he was a child. He displayed a knack for musical instruments, particularly keyboards such as the organ. His skill earned him gigs at churches and lounges down in Los Angeles.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In considering why he became a Satanist, LaVey described the dichotomy between seeing the same people partying late into the night at clubs and burlesque shows on Saturday and then attending church on Sunday. This moral double standard that he perceived turned him off to Christianity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A discredited legend that was perhaps peddled by LaVey himself asserts that he had an affair with Marilyn Monroe while working the Los Angeles nightclub scene.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He later moved back to San Francisco and began to study Satan and the occult. He began to develop a lifestyle and religion centered on the Church of Satan.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We don't worship Satan, we worship ourselves using the metaphorical representation of the qualities of Satan,’ he noted in Barton’s book.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The extent to which his church was authentic and to what extent he was a bit of a showboat is rife for discussion.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He was known to exaggerate, if not outright lie, about his exploits.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For example, he claimed to have shaved his head in 1966 in a ritual inspired by the devil-worshipping Yezidi people of Iraq so as to become the High Priest of Satan. In reality, his then-wife, Dian Hegarty, had simply dared him to do it. No such ritual even exists among the Yezidi people.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But LaVey seemed to be in on the spectacle.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m one helluva liar. Most of my adult life, I’ve been accused of being a charlatan, a phony, an impostor. I guess that makes me about as close to what the Devil’s supposed to be, as anyone. It’s true. I lie constantly, incessantly. Because I lie so often, I’d really be full of s*** if I didn’t keep my mouth shut and my bowels open,’ he wrote in his book, ‘Satan Speaks!‘</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>LaVey married Carole Lansing in 1951. They had one daughter, Karla (born 1952). He divorced Lansing in 1960 and began a 25-year partnership with Diane Hegarty, with whom he had a daughter named Zeena (born 1963). Barton, with whom he had a relationship after his breakup with Hegarty, alleges that Hegarty did not mind the relationship her husband had with Jayne Mansfield. With Barton, he had a son named Satan Xerxes Carnacki (born 1993).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>LaVey stuck with his brand of Satanism through various low points: The Charles Manson clan murders of Sharon Tate (who was married to Rosemary’s Baby director Roman Polanski) and four other people that were linked to Satanism; a mass desertion of the church in favor of a rival in 1975; the Satanic Panic that asserted children were being abused during Satanic rituals.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1997, he died of pulmonary edema. He was 67.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Walter Fischer, sometime after documenting the exploits of the blonde and the Satanist, returned to his native Germany, where he died in 2000. Not much else is known about him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He was not very much in front of the camera, just behind the camera,’ said Swedish collector Alf Wahlgren, 47.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And Fischer’s photographic archive seemed lost to old newspaper clippings until a German man named Sebastian contacted Wahlgren about his collection of 50,000 of Fischer’s photographs. Gradually, Wahlgren procured the photos.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Wahlgren, who lives in Uppsala, contacted Abrahamsson, who lives in Stockholm, about his findings. Despite their geographic proximity and shared interest in ‘LaVeyana,’ they had never crossed paths.</p><img id=i-9636084678d19e7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/18/17/4274122D00000578-4707902-image-a-18_1500396298221.jpg height=560 width=470 alt="The book is available to order from JD Holmes in the United States and Trapart in Europe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The book is available to order from JD Holmes in the United States and Trapart in Europe</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The thousands of photographs delighted Abrahamsson, who wrote an ode to Mansfield called ‘Sweet Jayne’ while in a band as a teenager.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It blew my mind, because it took me straight back to my teens, which of course, those years are important in everyone’s lives,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The pair analyzed the thousands of photographs, including around 900 that were specifically of LaVey and Mansfield.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I was one hundred per cent sure about which pictures that should be put in the book. And then Carl, he’s phenomenal at editing and putting the pictures together in the book. So it was a really nice cooperation,’ Wahlgren said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Only 400 copies of the book’s first edition were printed in 2016.
