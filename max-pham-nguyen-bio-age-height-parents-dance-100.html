Well, after their break up, he went off the spotlight for a while only to appear as one of the contestants on Netflix’s </span><i><span>Dance 100</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>This Max Pham Nguyen Bio is all about him.</span></p><h3><b>Max Pham Nguyen On Netflix’s Dance 100</b></h3><p><span>Netflix’s </span><i><span>Dance 100</span></i><span> premiered on March 17, 2023, and it featured eight choreographers as they battled it out for a chance to win a $100,000 cash prize. As for the misleading “100” in the title, it referred to the 100 dancers, who danced to some seriously complex routines whilst also judging the choreographers</span></p><p><span>Our star, Max Pham Nguyen was one of these choreographers who was outed early from the show. He only could choreograph a few routines for 7 -14 dancers before they decided to eliminate him.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, his co-stars Keenan Cooks and Brandi Chun made it to the finale where they were asked to prepare a routine for 50 dancers and another for all the 100 members of the Dance 100 crew. Knowing what was at the stake, both of the participants gave their best before Keenan ultimately lost the battle to Brandi Chun.</span></p><p><span>Other participants who went home empty-handed alongside Max were Akira Armstrong, Celine Edmonson, Janick Areseneau, Rex Kline, and Rudy Garcia.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Max Pham Nguyen Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Max Pham Nguyen garnered a net worth of above $450 thousand by 2023.</span></p><p><span>This talented dancer started his career in June 2009 as a dance instructor, motion entertainment choreographer, dancer, and director. After gracing multiple stages as The Armada ID, Miss Teen Idaho, ID21 Awards Show, Special Olympics ’09, Choreographers Carnival – August 2013, Shades of Black Show Boise State, Shades of Black Show U of I, iAmFusion Awards Show ’13, and Pattcasso: The Black Affair ’12 & ’13, he then joined </span><i><span>Bloc Talent Agency Inc.</span></i><span> in Jan 2014.</span></p><p><i><span>Bloc Talent Agency Inc</span></i><span> is also where his co-star Keenan Cooks worked.</span></p><p><span>Besides live/stage performances, Max has also worked on TV shows and movies such as Beachbody Fitness DVD P90, Kohl’s “Share Pink,” St. Lukes’s Hospital, and Hewlett Packard.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, as a choreographer, he has worked with celebrities like Ariana Grande, Justin Timberlake, Milli, Meg Donnelly, and Elyanna.</span></p><p><span>In case you’re looking for a lesson, find him at Millennium Dance Complex, Studio C Academy of Dance, Elevated Dance Project, Meridian Stars Dance, The Dance Centre, Vibe Performing Arts Center, The University of Idaho, and Boise State University.</span></p><p><span>As for his qualifications, he’s trained with Urban Legends LA, Marty Kudelka, David Moore, Joaquin Escamilla, Jen Parsons, Miguel Zarate, Karon Lynn, Movement Lifestyle Tour LA, Kevin Maher, Anthony Thomas, and Groovaloos.</span></p><p><span>His specialties include Partnering, Popping, Locking, Bboying, House Dance, Lofting, Tutting, Waves, Hip Hop, Jazz, Stepping, Isolations, Tricking, Tap</span></p><p><span>Also, he’s a </span><i><span>College of Idaho</span></i><span> 2013 graduate.</span></p><h3><b>Max Pham Nguyen Age</b></h3><p><span>Max Pham Nguyen was 32 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>Dance 100</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Max Pham Nguyen Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Max Pham Nguyen was born to his parents, Nancy and Bruce H Nguyen.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Max’s dad was never supportive of his dancing career. “You don’t mean sh*t to me, I’ve given up, my friends at work ask me how my son is doing. I’m f**king embarrassed to tell them, I’m embarrassed of you. By now you should be able to afford your own car, insurance, gas, and food, and have your own place. You should be making enough to live on your own. All this dance shit is taking you nowhere. Go upstairs and think about what I said,” these are the words Max remembers his dad telling him. He even recorded it on audio.</span></p><p><span>“What is the definition of a parent? One who loves and supports their own flesh and blood through thick and thin, correct? Welcome to the life of Max Nguyen. I need help…someone, please help me,” Max wrote when he was 19.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Max’s mother is his world. He often features her on his IG pics from their vacation trips.</span></p><p><span>Nancy and Bruce turned 54 and 58 years of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span>As for Max’s sibling, he has a 4-year-older brother named Michael P Nguyen. He was married to Jesica Nguyen (a CA native) with 2 kids.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span> During one of his speeches, Max’s father did a headstand to represent “breakdancing” and he fell!</span></p><h3><b>Max Pham Nguyen Girlfriend</b></h3><p><span>Max Pham Nguyen officially dated his girlfriend Jessie J from March to October 2021. First sharing the good news, Jessie took to her IG to feature Max with a caption, “Got me looking like an old man who owns a boat, basically Lord Farquards Dad growing out an old haircut. 😂😩”</span></p><p><span>Jessie was also the one to break the news about their split in an IG Q&A. “(I‘m) open, happy, and loving myself. Max and I have been friends for a while now. We both have so much love and respect for each other. It just wasn’t right romantically. So we both decided friends it is,” the singer wrote.</span></p><p><span>Also, Jessie added, “I hate how much of a big deal other people can make your personal breakups. We are both happy, living and loving our lives.”</span></p><p><span>Thereafter, Jessie went on to date <a href=#>Chanan Safir Colman</a> (a professional basketball player) in early 2022.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Max stopped sharing his love life.</span></p><h3><b>Max Pham Nguyen Height</b></h3><p><span>Max Pham Nguyen stands tall at a height of 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his distinct features, Max has brown eyes, dark hair, a sharp jawline, tattoos on his hand and arm, and a fit body.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>What Is Max Pham Nguyen Nationality?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Max Pham is an American from Irving, Texas.
