Some online critics questioned everything from her singing ability to her grammar.</p><p>Alaskan Bush People, a Discovery Channel documentary-style reality TV show, documented Rain and her family’s entire life. Rain also revealed in 2017 that she wanted to attend college. She did, however, continue to appear on Alaskan Bush People. She was unlikely to attend college.

Aside from the genuinely interested fans, some bullies mocked Rain for not accepting her sexuality.</p><p>The rain eventually addressed the rumors and stated unequivocally that she was gay. She, too, had fought back against the trolls, albeit in a calm and dignified manner. Rain explained that labeling her fandom rainbow was a clever play on words — she considered her fans to be “boo.”</p><p>As a result, the answer is no. Rain Brown, on the other hand, is not gay.</p><h2><span id=Brown_Rain_Boyfriend_Relationship_and_Child>Brown Rain Boyfriend, Relationship, and Child</span></h2><p>Now that the gay rumors were out of the way, there was some speculation about Rain Brown’s boyfriend. Rain was a very private person in 2021, and she refused to reveal anything about her dating life. Even in the show, there was no evidence that Rain had a boyfriend.</p><p>Rain was most likely still single, according to many online sources. The rain did come out once and declare her love for someone. But it was for Jackson, her dog. Aside from Jackson, Rain had another pet named Barnum.</p><p>There was also another rumor going around about Rain’s personal life. Some media outlets speculated that Rain was pregnant and had already given birth to a child. However, the rumors were not confirmed yet again.</p><p>Rain believed she had a special relationship with God when she was 17 years old. Perhaps God and her two pets were sufficient for the time being, and a boyfriend was something to look forward to in the future.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Reality TV star</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>All About Montana Brown | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>American reality TV star and college student Montana Brown.
