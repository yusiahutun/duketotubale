It was there, in the city state, that she experienced first-hand the awesome networking power of the Auntie.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her parents did not live in Singapore with her, yet they would often find out about the things she and her cousins did.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I slowly found out it was because of the aunties and uncles network,” said Sutanto, 36.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If I went to Orchard Road with a guy, then an aunt’s friend would see, and she would tell her friends. Then suddenly my parents would be like ‘oh my god, you went out with a guy on Orchard Road’.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another thing that shaped her experience of Singapore was how kiasu, or competitive, the environment was.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Singapore is so different from Indonesia even though it’s so nearby … I think Indonesia is a bit more relaxed. I feel like a lot of Chinese-Indonesians, including my family, are more like Singaporeans, very kiasu and very competitive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I remember being compared a lot to my parents’ friends’ children. They’d be like ‘Look at these children of my friend, they’re very smart and just got accepted into a prestigious school,” the mother of two recalled.<br></p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Are you crazy?

Judges described Dial A for Aunties as a “delicious frantic comedy caper”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The book was packed with “absurd situations, hilarious dialogue, wonderful family dynamics and crackling with comic energy”, chair of the judges Joanne Harris said, reported The Guardian.</p>Sutanto lived in Singapore until she was 17, then she left for the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">United States</span></a> to attend UCLA Berkeley, before moving to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Britain</span></a> to pursue her master’s in creative writing at Oxford.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/28/ecd9dc1b-1c50-4423-a1ef-a9b9b8628f6e_aacee1e4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asked why she wasn’t interested in portraying her uncles for her novel, she said aunties were “more interesting” as they played an important role in Asian cultures and families and life without them would be less lively.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s very interesting that in the Western media, Asian women are portrayed to be very quiet and submissive, whereas if you actually go to Asia and you meet the Asian aunties here, they’re very loud and very domineering and they do what they want. They control everything. And so I wanted to show that actually Asian aunties are such a powerhouse in Asian cultures and families.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Charlotte Setijadi, assistant professor of humanities at School of Social Sciences at Singapore Management University, echoed Sutanto’s assessment, saying that in Asian cultures aunties generally had “influential” roles because “the kinship and social networks are still very much family based” and society was usually more “collective, more communitarian” than in the West.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You can say that aunties, perhaps more so than uncles, have been portrayed to have more to do with the maintenance of the family’s social standing and social network,” Setijadi said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And that’s why the stereotypes that we have, of the matchmaking aunties, or the gossiping aunties, have to do with the maintenance of the social status quo in the family.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">If you actually go to Asia and you meet the Asian aunties here, they’re very loud and very domineering</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aunties’ characteristics were formed by the society they belonged to, Setijadi said. In most societies, paternalistic cultures in which women were responsible for child rearing contributed to aunties’ meddlesome reputation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“While aunties exist in all cultures, specifically within Asian societies, where gender roles are more defined compared to other cultures, aunties are even more ubiquitous,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Asia, it is also common for multiple households to live in one big house or family compound. This has led to another stereotype for aunties, in which they are seen as being a “second mother” – “disciplinarians [and gossipy] because they’re so close to the bringing up of a lot of Asian children,” Setijadi said.</p>Aunties need not be blood relatives. In <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Indonesia</span></a>, for example, it is common for people to refer to the female friends of their parents as “tante” – which means auntie in Dutch and Bahasa Indonesia. “Tante”, however, would not be an appropriate term for older females who are not known to the speaker. These would commonly be referred to as “Ibu” or “ma’am”.However, in Singapore and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Malaysia</span></a>, any middle-aged woman can be called auntie.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The auntie stereotype does not belong exclusively to Asian cultures.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What’s really interesting is that since Dial A for Aunties was released, I’ve actually received a lot of emails and messages from people from different cultures, such as Mexico, Jamaica and Nigeria who say their aunties are exactly like that. I’ve received messages from Jewish, Filipino, and Indian readers, too. It brings me so much joy to know that across so many different cultures, aunties seem to be very, very similar,” Sutanto said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She added, though, that “a lot of my Caucasian readers have written to me saying, ‘I wish that my family was more like that’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/28/281b7205-49ad-40e8-bddc-5616852fcdc7_4ee34590.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Diversity push</strong></h3>For Sutanto, the year ahead will bring exciting and “intense” months, as she has sold the rights to Dial A For Aunties to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Netflix</span></a>. The movie script will be written by Kourtney Kang, a producer on Fresh off the Boat and How I Met Your Mother.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sutanto estimated the movie would wrap in 2023.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She also has four novels coming out this year: two young-adult novels, a fantasy novel, and a sequel to Dial A For Aunties that is coming in March and will be set in Oxford, England.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the young-adult novels is called Well, That Was Unexpected and will be set in Jakarta and Bali.

I really hope that Dial A For Aunties also gives Indonesia a bit more recognition,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sutanto hopes that none of her real-life aunties recognise themselves in the characters in her book.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was very careful to disguise a lot of the characters to the point where my mom didn’t know which auntie was based on who, so I’m not in trouble with any of them,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think that they’re all very proud.
