Each team can earn up to $250,000.</p><p>Moving on to the main reason for this article, comedian Janelle is the host of the show. “The Final Straw is a fresh and exciting format that you truly have not seen anywhere else.

Then I had money in it you know but we had many points where both of us then have money so we were just always together you know to me so to move to champagne to have him get into this rigorous Ph.D.”</p><p>Jenelle and her husband were in different worlds.
